At other times, the brother would tell his little sister that only he knew how to play the piano. She could try, of course, but he was the only one with the talent. Then he'd play his fingers across the keys of the fancy piano, showing off his skill.
The little sister might pout, but eventually she'd join in, playing a song as brilliant as her brother's. They'd pause, then laugh and clap each other's hands. In the end, no one ever tired of playing the fancy piano, and it brought the brother and sister closer together each day."

Ben shrugged and said, ""I don't mind the dark. I have my flashlight. And I can see you when you come close.""
Lily shook her head and said, ""I don't like the dark. It makes me feel alone and sad. And I can't see your face.""
Ben looked at Lily and saw that she was upset. He felt sorry for scaring her. He said, ""I'm sorry, Lily. I didn't mean to make you feel bad. Do you want me to explain why I like the dark?""
Lily nodded and said, ""Yes, please. Explain to me why you like the dark.""
Ben took Lily's hand and said, ""Come, I'll show you."" He led her to the hole and turned on his flashlight. He said, ""Look, the dark is not so bad. It is like a secret place where you can imagine anything. You can pretend you are in a cave, or a spaceship, or a castle. You can make up stories and have fun.""
Lily looked at the hole and saw that it was not so scary with the flashlight. She saw some rocks, some leaves, and some bugs. She said, ""I see. The dark is like a game. You can use your flashlight to make shapes and shadows.""
Ben nodded and said, ""Yes, exactly. The dark is like a game. And you can play with me. We can be friends in the dark.""
Lily smiled and said, ""OK, Ben. I'll try to play with you in the dark. But can we also play in the light sometimes?""

One day, Sara was playing with her bear. She pretended that he was her friend and they went to the park. She said, ""Hello, bear. Do you want to go on the slide?"" The bear nodded and said, ""Yes, Sara. I like the slide. It is fast and fun."" Sara smiled and took the bear to the slide. She put him on the top and pushed him down. The bear laughed and said, ""Whee! That was fun. Thank you, Sara.""
Sara and the bear played on the slide for a long time. They also played on the swings, the seesaw and the sandbox. They had a lot of fun. But soon, Sara felt tired. She yawned and said, ""I am sleepy, bear. Let's go home."" The bear yawned too and said, ""Me too, Sara. Let's go home and take a nap.""
Sara and the bear walked back to her room. They saw that Sara's mom was waiting for them. She said, ""Hello, Sara. Hello, bear. Did you have fun at the park?"" Sara nodded and said, ""Yes, mom. We had fun. But we are sleepy now. Can we take a nap?"" Sara's mom smiled and said, ""Of course, Sara. You can take a nap. But first, you need to wash your hands and face. You are dirty and smelly from playing."" Sara said, ""Okay, mom. I will wash my hands and face. But what about the bear? He is dirty and smelly too."" Sara's mom said, ""Don't worry, Sara. I will wash the bear for you. He needs a bath too. Then he will be clean and soft again.""
Sara and the bear washed their hands and face. Then Sara's mom took the bear and put him in the sink. She used soap and water to wash him. She rinsed him and dried him with a towel. She gave him back to Sara and said, ""Here you go, Sara. Your bear is clean and soft now. He smells good too."" Sara hugged the bear and said, ""Thank you, mom. You are the best. I love you and I love the bear."" Sara's mom said, ""I love you too, Sara. And I love the bear too. Now, let's go to your bed and take a nap. You need to rest after playing so much."" Sara and the bear said, ""Okay, mom. Let's go to bed and take a nap."" They followed Sara's mom to the bed. They snuggled under the blanket and closed their eyes. They fell asleep and dreamed of the park. They were happy."
"Lily loves to sing. She sings when she wakes up, when she plays, and when she goes to bed. She sings songs about flowers, stars, and animals. She sings with her voice, her hands, and her feet.
One night, Lily has a dream. She sees a big, bright light in the sky. She hears a soft, sweet sound. She looks up and sees an angel. The angel has white wings, a long dress, and a shiny crown. The angel smiles at Lily and says, ""Hello, little singer. I like your songs. Do you want to sing with me?""
Lily nods her head. She feels happy and curious. She says, ""Yes, please. What is your name? Where do you come from?""
The angel says, ""My name is Joy. I come from heaven. Heaven is a place where God and his friends live. We sing praises to God and thank him for his love. Do you know God?""
Lily says, ""Yes, I know God. He made me and he loves me. He gave me my family and my friends. He gave me my voice and my songs. I want to thank him too. Can you teach me a song?""
The angel says, ""Of course. Listen to me and repeat after me."" The angel sings a simple, beautiful song. Lily listens and repeats. They sing together, louder and louder. The light in the sky grows wider and wider. Lily feels warm and peaceful. She thinks, ""This is the best dream ever."""
"Lila and Ben were best friends. They liked to play in the park with their toys. Lila had a doll and Ben had a car. They shared their snacks and had fun.
One day, they saw a big orange cat in the park. It was sitting on a bench, licking its paw. Lila and Ben wanted to pet the cat. They walked slowly towards it.
""Meow,"" the cat said. It looked at them with green eyes.
""Hello, cat,"" Lila said. ""You are very pretty. Can we pet you?""
The cat did not answer. It arched its back and hissed.
""Be careful,"" Ben said. ""The cat does not like us. It might scratch us.""
Lila did not listen to Ben. She reached out her hand to touch the cat. The cat swiped at her with its claws.
""Ow!"" Lila cried. She pulled back her hand. It had a red mark on it. It hurt a lot.
""I told you to be careful,"" Ben said. He was a reliable friend. He always warned Lila when something was dangerous. He took out a tissue from his pocket and wrapped it around Lila's hand.
""Thank you, Ben,"" Lila said. She was sorry she did not listen to him. She hugged him.
The cat jumped off the bench and ran away. Lila and Ben decided to leave the cat alone. They went back to their toys and played some more. They were happy."
"Lily and Tom were hungry. They wanted to eat soup for lunch. Mom said she would make soup for them. She went to the kitchen and put a pot on the stove.
Lily and Tom followed Mom to the kitchen. They saw a big spoon on the counter. It was shiny and silver. Lily liked shiny things. She wanted to play with the spoon.
""Can I have the spoon, Mom?"" Lily asked.
""No, Lily, that spoon is for the soup. You can have another spoon to play with,"" Mom said.
But Lily did not listen. She reached for the shiny spoon when Mom was not looking. She grabbed it and ran away.
Tom saw Lily run away with the spoon. He was confused. Why did Lily take the spoon? He wanted to help Mom with the soup. He ran after Lily.
""Lily, give back the spoon! Mom needs it for the soup!"" Tom shouted.
Lily did not want to give back the spoon. She liked the shiny spoon. She ran to her room and hid under the bed.
Tom followed Lily to her room. He looked under the bed. He saw Lily and the spoon.
""Lily, please give back the spoon. The soup will be ready soon. We can share the soup and eat it with our own spoons,"" Tom said.
Lily looked at Tom. She saw that he was sad. She felt sorry for Tom. She did not want to make him sad. She decided to give back the spoon.
""Okay, Tom, I will give back the spoon. I'm sorry I took it. I just liked the shiny spoon,"" Lily said.
She gave the spoon to Tom. Tom smiled and thanked her. He took the spoon to the kitchen and gave it to Mom.
Mom was happy to see the spoon. She stirred the soup with the spoon. She smelled the soup. It was hot and yummy.
""Soup is ready, Lily and Tom! Come and eat!"" Mom called.
Lily and Tom ran to the kitchen. They sat at the table and waited for Mom to serve them soup. They each got a bowl of soup and a spoon. They ate the soup and enjoyed it.
They were not hungry anymore. They were happy. They liked soup. They liked Mom. They liked each other. They learned to share. They learned to listen. They learned to say sorry. They learned to shine."
"Lily and Ben are playing in the park. They find a shiny stone on the ground. Lily picks it up and puts it in her pocket.
""Can I see it?"" Ben asks.
""No, it is mine!"" Lily says.
""Please, just for a moment,"" Ben begs.
Lily refuses. She holds her pocket tight. She does not want to share.
Ben is sad. He tries to grab the stone from Lily's pocket. Lily screams and pushes him away. Ben falls and hurts his knee. He cries.
Lily feels bad. She sees blood on Ben's knee. She remembers that Ben is her friend. She takes the stone out of her pocket and gives it to Ben.
""Here, you can have it,"" she says.
""Thank you, Lily,"" Ben says. He smiles and wipes his tears.
They hug and say sorry. They share the stone and play together. They are happy."
"Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play together. They have a big box of toys. They have cars, dolls, balls, and books.
One day, Lily finds a star in the box. It is shiny and yellow. She likes the star. She puts it on her head. She says, ""I am a princess. This is my crown.""
Ben sees the star. He wants the star. He is jealous of Lily. He says, ""Give me the star. It is mine.""
Lily says, ""No, it is mine. I found it first.""
Ben and Lily start to fight. They pull the star. They yell and cry.
Mom hears the noise. She comes to the room. She sees Ben and Lily fighting. She is not happy. She says, ""Stop fighting. The star is for sharing. You can both play with it. Or you can play with something else. But you have to be nice to each other.""
Ben and Lily feel sorry. They say, ""Sorry, Mom. Sorry, Lily. Sorry, Ben.""
Mom gives them a hug. She says, ""It's okay. I love you both. Now, let's play together.""
Ben and Lily smile. They share the star. They take turns to wear it. They play princess and knight. They have fun. They are friends again."
"Ben and Mia are playing in the backyard. They have a small table and some cups and plates. They pretend they are having a tea party.
""Would you like some more tea, Mia?"" Ben asks, holding a cup.
""Yes, please, Ben. You are a good server,"" Mia says, smiling.
They sip their pretend tea and chat about their toys and pets. They hear a noise at the gate. It is the mailman. He has a big bag of mail.
""Hello, Ben and Mia. I have some mail for you,"" the mailman says, waving.
""Mail for us? Wow!"" Ben and Mia say, running to the gate.
The mailman gives them each a colorful envelope. They have stickers and drawings on them.
""Who are they from?"" Ben asks, curious.
""They are from your grandma and grandpa. They live far away, but they love you very much. They wrote you some letters and sent you some pictures,"" the mailman explains.
""Thank you, mailman. You are very nice,"" Mia says, grateful.
""You're welcome, kids. Have fun reading your mail. And be careful with the scissors,"" the mailman says, leaving.
Ben and Mia run back to their table. They open their envelopes with scissors. They find letters and pictures inside. They see their grandma and grandpa smiling and waving. They read their letters out loud. They say they miss them and they are proud of them. They also send them some jokes and riddles.
""Grandma and grandpa are very funny,"" Ben says, laughing.
""They are also very serious. They say we have to be good and listen to our mom and dad,"" Mia says, nodding.
""We will, grandma and grandpa. We love you too,"" Ben and Mia say, looking at the pictures.
They put their letters and pictures on their table. They finish their tea party. They hug each other. They are happy. They have mail."
"Anna and Ben are playing with blocks in the living room. They like to build towers and houses and bridges with the blocks. They have many colors of blocks: red, blue, yellow, green, and more.
""Look, Anna, I made a big tower!"" Ben says, showing his blocks to his sister. ""It is very high and strong!""
Anna looks at Ben's tower and smiles. She likes his tower, but she also wants to make her own. She picks up some blocks and starts to build next to Ben.
""Can I have some of your blocks, Ben?"" Anna asks. ""I need more to make my tower.""
Ben shakes his head. ""No, Anna, these are my blocks. You have your own blocks. Go away!""
Anna feels sad and angry. She does not like Ben's answer. She wants to share the blocks with him. She thinks he is being mean and selfish.
She decides to do something bad. She pushes Ben's tower with her hand. The blocks fall down and break. They make a loud noise.
""Anna, why did you do that?"" Ben cries. ""You broke my tower! You are a bad sister!""
Anna feels sorry for what she did. She sees Ben's tears and hears his cry. She knows she made a mistake.
""I'm sorry, Ben, I'm sorry!"" Anna says. ""I did not mean to break your tower. I was mad at you, but I should not have pushed your blocks. Can you forgive me?""
Ben looks at Anna and sees her face. She looks sad and sorry too. He remembers that she is his sister and he loves her.
""It's okay, Anna, I forgive you,"" Ben says. ""But don't do that again, okay? It is not nice to break other people's things.""
Anna nods and hugs Ben. ""Okay, Ben, I won't do that again. I love you, brother.""
They hug and make up. They decide to share the blocks and build a new tower together. They have fun and play nicely.
The end."
"Ben and Lily were twins who liked to play in their room. They had many toys and books and a big bed with soft cushions. One day, they found a new game. They took the cushions and piled them up on the floor. Then they climbed on the bed and jumped on the cushions. They laughed and shouted as they bounced up and down.
""Look at me, I'm a mighty lion!"" Ben roared, pretending to have claws and teeth.
""I'm a mighty princess!"" Lily said, wearing a crown and a necklace.
They had so much fun that they did not hear their mom calling them for lunch. She came to their room and saw the mess. She was angry and told them to stop jumping and clean up.
""But mom, we're having fun!"" Ben said, not wanting to stop.
""Yeah, mom, please let us play a little more!"" Lily said, urging her mom to change her mind.
""No, you have to eat and then take a nap. You're making too much noise and you're ruining the cushions. They're not for jumping, they're for sleeping. Now come on, or you'll be in trouble."" Mom said, grabbing their hands and pulling them away from the bed.
Ben and Lily were sad and mad. They did not want to eat or nap. They wanted to play. They thought their mom was mean and unfair. They did not say thank you or sorry. They pouted and whined all the way to the kitchen.
But when they came back to their room after their nap, they saw something terrible. The cushions were torn and ripped. The stuffing was everywhere. Their toys and books were broken and dirty. And on the wall, there was a big scratch and a note. It said: ""I'm a mighty lion too. And I don't like noisy kids. Next time, be quiet and listen to your mom. Or I'll come back and eat you. Grrr!""
It was their cat, Fluffy, who had done it. He was hiding under the bed, looking smug and satisfied. He had heard them jumping and roaring and had decided to join the game. But he had played too rough and had destroyed everything.
Ben and Lily were shocked and scared. They cried and hugged each other. They wished they had listened to their mom and not jumped on the cushions. They learned their lesson the hard way. They realized that their mom was right and that they had been wrong. They said sorry to their mom and to each other. They helped her clean up the mess and promised to be good and quiet from then on. They hoped that Fluffy would not come back and eat them. They hoped that their mom would forgive them and love them still. They hoped that their cushions would be fixed and their toys and books would be replaced. They hoped that they would find a new game that was fun and safe and did not make anyone angry or sad.
The end."
"Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They saw a big green apple on a tree. Lily wanted to eat it, but Ben wanted to throw it.
""Give me the apple, Lily. I want to play with it,"" Ben said.
""No, Ben. It is my apple. I want to eat it. It is yummy,"" Lily said.
They pulled the apple from each other. The apple broke in half. They both dropped the pieces.
""Oh no! We destroyed the apple!"" Lily cried.
A bird flew down and picked up one piece. A squirrel ran and took the other piece.
""Look, Lily. The bird and the squirrel are happy. They like the apple,"" Ben said.
""Maybe they are hungry. Maybe we can share with them,"" Lily said.
They smiled and waved at the bird and the squirrel. They went to find more apples to share."
"Lily and Ben were playing with marbles on the floor. They had many marbles of different colors and sizes. They liked to roll them and make them hit each other.
""Look, I have a big red marble. It is mighty. It can knock down all your marbles,"" Ben said. He rolled his red marble and hit Lily's blue marble. Lily's blue marble rolled away.
""That is not nice, Ben. You should share your marbles and play fair,"" Lily said. She was sad and angry.
""I don't want to share. I want to win. My red marble is the best,"" Ben said. He rolled his red marble again and hit Lily's green marble. Lily's green marble rolled away.
Lily had only one marble left. It was a small yellow marble. She did not think it was mighty. She thought it was weak. She wanted to cry.
But then she had an idea. She picked up her yellow marble and poked Ben's red marble with it. Ben's red marble did not roll. It cracked.
""Hey, what did you do? You broke my red marble. That is not fair,"" Ben said. He was shocked and sad.
""I poked it. You said it was mighty, but it was not. It was fragile. You should not be mean and boastful. You should be kind and humble,"" Lily said. She felt sorry for Ben, but also proud of her yellow marble.
Ben looked at his broken red marble and then at Lily's yellow marble. He realized that he was wrong. He said sorry to Lily and asked her to be his friend. Lily smiled and said yes. They hugged and shared their marbles. They learned that size and color do not matter. What matters is how you treat others."
"Lily and Tom are playing in the kitchen. They want to cook a cake for mom. Lily is bossy. She tells Tom what to do.
""Tom, get the eggs. Tom, get the flour. Tom, get the milk. Tom, get the sugar. Tom, get the bowl. Tom, get the spoon. Tom, get the pan. Tom, hurry up!"" Lily says.
Tom is tired of Lily's orders. He does not have fun. He wants to do something else.
""Lily, I don't want to cook. I want to play with my cars. You are too bossy. You do everything yourself."" Tom says.
Lily is angry. She wants to cook with Tom. She thinks cooking is fun. She does not want to play with cars. She thinks cars are boring.
""Tom, you are silly. Cooking is fun. Cars are boring. You have to help me. We are a team. Mom will be happy if we cook a cake for her."" Lily says.
Tom and Lily start to argue. They raise their voices. They make a mess. They spill the eggs, the flour, the milk, and the sugar. They drop the bowl, the spoon, and the pan. They do not notice mom coming home.
Mom sees the kitchen. She sees Lily and Tom. She is not happy. She is angry.
""Lily and Tom, what are you doing? Why are you making such a noise? Why are you making such a mess? You are not cooking. You are fighting. You are not a team. You are naughty."" Mom says.
Lily and Tom feel sorry. They stop arguing. They apologize to mom. They help mom clean the kitchen. They hug mom. They say they love her.
Mom forgives Lily and Tom. She hugs them back. She says she loves them too. She says they can cook a cake together another day. She says they have to be nice to each other. She says they have to share and take turns. She says they have to have fun."
"Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to run and jump and slide. They saw a big hill with a lot of trees. They wanted to discover what was on the other side.
""Let's go, Lily!"" Ben said. ""Maybe we can find a treasure or a secret cave!""
""OK, Ben!"" Lily said. ""But be careful. It looks dark and spooky over there.""
They ran up the hill, holding hands. They heard a loud noise. It was the wind. It was blowing hard and making the trees shake and the leaves fly.
""Wow, look at the wind, Lily!"" Ben said. ""It's so strong and fast!""
Lily felt scared. She did not like the wind. It made her cold and it made her hair go in her eyes. She wanted to go back to the park.
""Ben, I don't like the wind,"" Lily said. ""Can we go back, please?""
Ben looked at Lily. He saw that she was scared. He wanted to make her feel better.
""OK, Lily,"" Ben said. ""We can go back. But first, let's do something fun. Let's make a kite!""
Ben found a stick and a plastic bag. He tied the bag to the stick with a string. He gave it to Lily.
""Here, Lily,"" Ben said. ""This is a kite. You can hold it and let the wind lift it up. It will fly like a bird!""
Lily took the kite. She felt curious. She wanted to try it.
""Thank you, Ben,"" Lily said. ""How do I make it fly?""
Ben showed her how to hold the string and run with the kite. They ran down the hill, laughing and shouting. The kite flew high in the sky, dancing with the wind.
Lily felt happy. She liked the kite. She liked the wind. She was not scared anymore.
She hugged Ben and said, ""You are the best, Ben. You made me discover something new and fun. I love you.""
Ben hugged her back and said, ""I love you too, Lily. You are the best, too. You made me discover something new and sweet."""
"Tom likes to polish his dad's razor. He thinks it is a shiny toy that makes his dad's face smooth. He waits for his dad to go to work, then he sneaks into the bathroom and takes the razor from the drawer. He rubs it with a cloth until it sparkles.
One day, Tom sees a unique thing on the wall. It is a big mirror that shows him and the razor. He wonders what will happen if he touches the razor to his face. He thinks it will make him look like his dad. He lifts the razor and moves it closer to his cheek.
But the razor is not a toy. It is sharp and hurts Tom. He feels a sting and sees red on his face and on the mirror. He drops the razor and starts to cry. He runs to his mom and shows her his boo-boo. She is scared and angry. She hugs him and puts a band-aid on his cut. She tells him to never touch the razor again. She says it is dangerous and not for kids.
Tom is sorry and sad. He does not want to polish the razor anymore. He says he is sorry to his mom and his dad. He learns his lesson and plays with his safe toys instead. He likes his cars and his blocks and his teddy bear. He does not need the razor to look like his dad. He loves his dad and his dad loves him, even with a band-aid on his face."
"Tim and Sue were friends. They liked to play with toys and eat snacks. One day, they found a big bag of prunes in the kitchen. They thought prunes were yummy and sweet.
""Let's eat some prunes!"" Tim said.
""OK!"" Sue said.
They opened the bag and took out some prunes. They put them in their mouths and chewed. But the prunes were not yummy and sweet. They were dry and sour and bitter. They made their faces twist and their tongues hurt.
""Yuck!"" Tim said. ""These prunes are stupid!""
""Yuck!"" Sue said. ""They are bad!""
They spat out the prunes and threw them on the floor. They were angry and sad. They wanted something good to eat.
They looked around the kitchen and saw a big cake on the table. It was white and pink and had candles on it. It looked yummy and sweet.
""Let's eat some cake!"" Tim said.
""OK!"" Sue said.
They ran to the table and grabbed some cake. They put it in their mouths and smiled. It was yummy and sweet. It made their faces happy and their tongues glad.
""Mmm!"" Tim said. ""This cake is good!""
""Mmm!"" Sue said. ""It is nice!""
They ate more and more cake. They did not care about the prunes. They did not see the note on the table. It said: ""Happy Birthday, Mom! Do not touch the cake!""
They ate all the cake. They felt full and sick. They clapped their hands and laughed. They thought they were clever and funny.
But they were not clever and funny. They were naughty and rude. They did not know that Mom was coming home soon. They did not know that Mom loved cake and wanted to share it with them. They did not know that Mom would be very angry and sad when she saw what they did.
They did not know that they were in big trouble.
The end."
"Anna liked to sign with her hands. She learned sign from her teacher at school. She had many friends who also signed. Anna was deaf, but she was not sad. She could talk and listen with her eyes and hands.
One day, Anna went to the park with her daddy. She saw a big slide and wanted to try it. She signed to her daddy, ""Can I go on the slide, please?"" Her daddy smiled and nodded. He signed, ""Yes, you can. Be careful and have fun.""
Anna ran to the slide and waited for her turn. She saw a boy in front of her. He had curly hair and a red shirt. He looked at Anna and said something. Anna did not hear him. She smiled and signed, ""Hello, I am Anna. What is your name?""
The boy frowned and said something again. He pointed at his mouth and shook his head. He did not sign. He did not understand Anna. He was ignorant. He pushed Anna and said, ""Go away, you are weird. You can't talk.""
Anna felt hurt and scared. She did not like the boy. She did not want to play with him. She ran back to her daddy and hugged him. She signed, ""Daddy, the boy was mean to me. He did not sign. He did not like me.""
Her daddy hugged her back and kissed her head. He signed, ""I am sorry, Anna. The boy was ignorant. He did not know how to sign. He did not know how to be kind. You are not weird. You are wonderful. You can talk. You can sign. You are my smart and brave girl. I love you."""
"Lily liked to play with her toys on the big cushion in the living room. She had a doll, a bear, a car and a ball. She made them talk and move and have fun. One day, she saw a fly on the cushion. It was not moving. Lily touched it with her finger. It was dead.
Lily felt sad for the fly. She wanted to help it. She ran to the kitchen and got a cup of water. She poured some water on the fly. Maybe it was thirsty, she thought. But the fly did not wake up. It was still dead.
Lily got an idea. She ran to her room and got a blanket. She wrapped the fly in the blanket and put it on the cushion. She said, ""Good night, fly. I hope you have good dreams."" Then she got her doll and hugged it. She said, ""Thank you, doll, for being my friend. You are not dead. You are alive and happy.""
Lily's mom came into the living room and saw Lily and her doll on the cushion. She smiled and said, ""What are you doing, Lily?"" Lily looked up and said, ""I am playing with my toys, mom. And I am saying thank you to them. They are good toys. They make me happy.""
Lily's mom sat down next to Lily and said, ""That's very nice of you, Lily. It's good to say thank you to the things and people that make you happy. And it's good to be kind to the things and people that are not happy. Like the fly. You tried to help the fly, didn't you?"" Lily nodded and said, ""Yes, mom. But the fly was dead. I could not make it alive. I was sad.""
Lily's mom hugged Lily and said, ""I know, Lily. Sometimes things die and we can't do anything about it. It's okay to be sad. But it's also okay to be happy. Because you have a lot of things and people that love you. Like me. And dad. And your toys. And the cushion. And the sun. And the moon. And the stars. And many more. Can you say thank you to them, too?"" Lily smiled and said, ""Yes, mom. Thank you, mom. Thank you, dad. Thank you, toys. Thank you, cushion. Thank you, sun. Thank you, moon. Thank you, stars. Thank you, thank you, thank you."""
"Ben and Lily were friends who liked to play together. They had different skin colors: Ben's skin was brown and Lily's skin was white. They did not care about that. They cared about having fun.
One day, they went to the park with their moms. They saw a big slide and ran to it. Ben went first and slid down fast. He laughed and said, ""That was fun! Come on, Lily!""
Lily climbed up the ladder and got ready to slide. But then she saw a boy with red hair and green eyes. He was waiting for his turn. He looked at Lily and said, ""Hey, you have weird skin. What is your name?""
Lily felt sad and scared. She did not like the boy's words. She said, ""My name is Lily. What is your name?""
The boy said, ""My name is Max. And I have the best skin. It is red and green, like a firework. You have boring skin. It is white, like snow. I am envious of nothing.""
Ben heard what Max said. He felt angry and brave. He climbed up the ladder and stood next to Lily. He said, ""You are wrong, Max. Lily's skin is not boring. It is beautiful, like a flower. And my skin is not weird. It is cool, like chocolate. We have different skin, but we are both good. You are envious of everything.""
Max did not know what to say. He felt ashamed and small. He ran away from the slide. Ben and Lily smiled at each other. They slid down together and hugged. They were happy and proud. Their moms saw them and clapped. They had the best skin. It was the skin of friends."
"Lily and Tom were playing dress-up in their room. They had many clothes and hats and shoes to try on. They liked to pretend they were different people and animals. Lily put on a red dress and a big hat. She said, ""I am a queen. You have to do what I say."" Tom put on a blue shirt and a tie. He said, ""I am a teacher. You have to learn what I teach.""
They played for a long time, but then they heard their mom call them for dinner. They had to end their game and go downstairs. They started to take off their clothes and put them back in the closet. But Lily wanted to keep her hat. She said, ""This is my hat. I want to wear it for dinner."" Tom said, ""No, you have to put it back. It is not yours. It is mom's hat. She will be mad if you take it.""
They began to fight over the hat. They pulled and tugged and shouted. The hat fell to the floor. They both reached for it, but they knocked over a hanger. The hanger hit the lamp and the lamp fell down. It made a loud noise and broke. They both stopped and looked at the mess. They were scared and sorry.
Mom heard the noise and came upstairs. She saw the broken lamp and the clothes and the hat. She was not happy. She said, ""What happened here? Why did you make such a mess? Why did you fight over the hat?"" Lily and Tom hung their heads. They said, ""We are sorry, mom. We were playing dress-up and we did not want to end. We both liked the hat and we did not share. We did not mean to break the lamp.""
Mom sighed and said, ""I understand you were having fun, but you have to be careful and respectful. The hat is mine and you have to ask me before you use it. The lamp is ours and you have to be gentle with it. The clothes are yours and you have to put them away. Now, help me clean up this mess and then we can go for dinner. And no more fighting, okay?""
Lily and Tom nodded and said, ""Okay, mom. We are sorry. We will help you. We will not fight."" They picked up the clothes and the hat and the hanger. They helped mom sweep the glass and fix the lamp. They hugged mom and said, ""We love you, mom. You are the best."" Mom smiled and said, ""I love you too, Lily and Tom. You are the best too. Now, let's go and eat. I made your favorite soup."" They went downstairs and ate their soup. They were calm and happy. They ended their day with a good night kiss."
"Sara and Ben were very happy. They were going on a holiday with Mum and Dad. They packed their bags with toys and clothes. They went to the big place where the planes fly.
Mum and Dad had to weigh their bags. They put them on a big scale. The scale said how heavy the bags were. Mum and Dad had to pay money for the bags. Sara and Ben did not have to weigh their bags. They were small and light.
They got on the plane. The plane was very big and loud. Sara and Ben sat by the window. They saw the clouds and the birds. They ate some snacks and played some games. They were very excited.
But then the plane hit some bad air. The plane shook and bounced. Sara and Ben felt scared. They held Mum and Dad's hands. Mum and Dad said it was OK. They said it was just a little bump.
The plane landed in a new place. It was very cold and white. Sara and Ben saw snow and ice. They wore their warm coats and hats. They got off the plane. They felt a bitter wind on their faces. They shivered and hugged Mum and Dad.
They got in a car. The car took them to a nice house. The house had a fire and a tree. The tree had lights and balls. Sara and Ben smiled. They said it was a beautiful holiday. They forgot about the bad air and the bitter wind. They were happy again."
"Ben and Sam were brothers. They liked to play in the cabin in the woods. The cabin was old and small, but it had many toys and books. Ben and Sam had fun with the toys and books.
One day, they heard a loud noise outside. They looked out the window and saw a big truck. The truck was red and shiny. It had a bald man driving it. The bald man got out of the truck and knocked on the door.
""Hello, boys,"" the bald man said. ""I'm sorry to delay your play, but I need to talk to your dad. He asked me to fix the roof of the cabin. It has a hole and it leaks when it rains.""
Ben and Sam were curious. They wanted to see the hole and the roof. They asked the bald man if they could help him.
""Sure, you can help me,"" the bald man said. ""But you have to be careful. The roof is high and steep. You have to wear these helmets and gloves. And you have to listen to me and do what I say.""
Ben and Sam nodded. They put on the helmets and gloves. They followed the bald man to the ladder. They climbed up the ladder and saw the hole. It was big and dark. The bald man had a hammer and some nails. He showed Ben and Sam how to fix the hole with some wood and tar.
Ben and Sam helped the bald man. They held the wood and the nails. They spread the tar. They hammered the nails. They worked hard and fast. They fixed the hole.
""Good job, boys,"" the bald man said. ""You are very brave and smart. You helped me a lot. Now the roof is good and strong. It won't leak anymore.""
Ben and Sam smiled. They were proud and happy. They thanked the bald man. They climbed down the ladder. They ran to the cabin. They told their dad what they did. Their dad hugged them and praised them. He gave them some cookies and milk. They ate the cookies and drank the milk. They went back to the cabin. They played with the toys and books. They had more fun."
"Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play with toys. One day, Tom brings a new toy to Mia's house. It is a magnet. A magnet can stick to some things, like metal.
Tom and Mia have fun with the magnet. They stick it to Mia's fridge, her spoon, her car, and her bell. They make loud noises and laugh. Mia's mom smiles and says, ""Welcome, Tom. I'm glad you came to play.""
But after a while, Tom and Mia get tired. They yawn and rub their eyes. They want to take a nap. Mia's mom says, ""You can sleep in Mia's room. She has a cozy bed and a soft pillow.""
Tom and Mia go to Mia's room. They bring the magnet with them. They put it on Mia's nightstand, next to her lamp. They cuddle under the blanket and close their eyes. They dream of more things to stick with the magnet. They are happy."
"Lila and Tom were playing with their toys in the garden. Lila had a big doll that she liked very much. Tom had a small car that he liked very much. They were happy and shared their toys.
But then, a big dog came and saw the toys. The dog ran and grabbed the doll with its mouth. Lila was scared and cried. ""No, no, that is mine! Give it back!"" she shouted. Tom tried to help her and threw a stick at the dog. But the dog did not care and ran away with the doll.
Lila and Tom ran after the dog. They saw the dog go into a house. They knocked on the door. A lady opened the door. She saw the dog with the doll. She saw Lila and Tom. She was angry and ashamed.
""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, this is my dog. He is naughty and likes to carry things. He did not mean to hurt you. Here, take your doll back. And here, have a cookie. I'm very sorry,"" she said.
Lila and Tom took their doll and their cookie. They thanked the lady and went back to the garden. They hugged their toys and each other. They were happy again. They learned to be careful with their toys and to forgive others."
"Tom was a king. He had a big crown made of gold and jewels. He liked to wear his crown and sit on his throne. He felt very important and proud.
One day, he had to go to a party with other kings and queens. He wanted to show off his crown and make them jealous. He put on his best clothes and his crown and walked to his carriage.
But on the way, he did not see a stone on the ground. He stumbled and fell. His crown flew off his head and rolled away. He hurt his knee and his nose. He cried out loud.
""Help! Help! Where is my crown?"" he shouted.
A girl who was passing by heard him. She saw his crown and picked it up. She ran to him and gave it back.
""Here is your crown, sir. Are you okay?"" she asked.
Tom took his crown and looked at it. It was dirty and bent. Some of the jewels were missing. He felt miserable.
""Thank you, but my crown is ruined. It is not shiny and pretty anymore. The other kings and queens will laugh at me. I don't want to go to the party anymore,"" he said.
The girl felt sorry for him. She smiled and said, ""Don't be sad, sir. Your crown is not the most important thing. You are still a king. You have a big heart and a kind voice. You can make people happy and help them. That is what makes you a good king. The other kings and queens will like you for who you are, not for what you wear.""
Tom listened to her words. He wiped his tears and smiled back. He realized she was right. He thanked her and hugged her. He put on his crown and got on his carriage. He went to the party and had fun. He made new friends and learned new things. He was happy and proud. He never forgot the girl who helped him. He always remembered to be a good king."
"Sara and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big tree with a swing. Sara and Tom run to the swing. They take turns to push each other.
""Look, I can hang from the swing!"" Sara says. She lets go of the rope and holds on with her hands.
""Wow, you are brave!"" Tom says. He claps his hands.
Sara swings back and forth. She feels happy. She sees a bird on a branch. The bird sings a song.
""Hello, bird!"" Sara says. ""Do you want to play with us?""
The bird flies down and lands on Sara's shoulder. It pecks her ear gently.
""Hi, Sara!"" the bird says. ""You are kind. I like you.""
Sara smiles. She strokes the bird's feathers.
""What is your name?"" she asks.
""My name is Spirit,"" the bird says. ""I am a magic bird. I can talk to children who are kind and have fun.""
Sara and Tom are surprised. They have never met a magic bird before.
""Can we be your friends?"" Tom asks.
""Of course!"" Spirit says. ""You are both kind and have fun. You have a good spirit. Come, let's play some more!""
Sara, Tom, and Spirit play on the swing, on the slide, and on the seesaw. They laugh and sing. They have a wonderful time. They are happy."
"Tom and Anna are having lunch with Mom and Dad. They have soup and bread and cheese. Tom likes soup, but Anna does not. She makes a face and pushes her bowl away.
""Anna, you have to eat your soup. It is good for you,"" Mom says.
""I don't like soup. It is hot and wet and yucky,"" Anna says.
""Look, Anna, you can use your fork to eat the cheese. Cheese is yummy and soft and yellow,"" Dad says. He shows Anna how to cut the cheese with his fork.
Anna looks at Dad's fork. It is big and shiny and has four teeth. She likes Dad's fork. She reaches for it, but Dad stops her.
""No, Anna, this is my fork. You have your own fork. It is smaller and easier for you to hold,"" Dad says. He gives Anna her fork. It is not as big or shiny as Dad's fork. It has three teeth and a pink handle.
Anna looks at her fork. She does not like her fork. It is small and dull and has a silly color. She throws her fork on the floor and cries.
""Anna, that is not nice. You have to pick up your fork and say sorry,"" Mom says.
Anna does not want to pick up her fork or say sorry. She is angry and sad. She wants a big fork like Dad's. She thinks it is not fair.
Tom looks at Anna. He feels sorry for her. He likes his sister, even when she is silly. He has an idea. He picks up his fork and gives it to Anna.
""Here, Anna, you can have my fork. It is big and shiny and has four teeth, like Dad's. I don't mind. I can use my spoon to eat my soup,"" Tom says.
Anna looks at Tom's fork. She is surprised and happy. She takes Tom's fork and smiles.
""Thank you, Tom. You are a good brother. I am sorry I was mean,"" Anna says.
Mom and Dad look at Tom and Anna. They are proud and happy. They hug their children and praise them.
""That was very kind of you, Tom. You are a good sharer. And that was very nice of you, Anna. You are a good apologizer. We love you both very much,"" Mom and Dad say.
Tom and Anna hug Mom and Dad back. They love them too. They eat their lunch with their forks and spoons. They are a happy family."
"Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play with their toys in the garden. One day, Lily brought a new doll. It had long hair and a pretty dress. Ben wanted to play with it.
""Can I see your doll?"" Ben asked.
""OK, but be careful,"" Lily said. She gave him the doll.
Ben looked at the doll. He liked it very much. He wanted to keep it. He had an idea.
""Let's trade,"" he said. ""You can have my car. It is fast and shiny.""
Lily liked the car, but she loved her doll more. She shook her head.
""No, thank you. I want my doll back,"" she said.
Ben did not listen. He ran away with the doll. He hid it behind a bush. He thought Lily would not find it.
Lily was very sad. She wept. She looked for her doll. She could not see it.
""Ben, give me my doll. That is not nice,"" she cried.
Ben did not answer. He was happy with the doll. He did not care about Lily.
Lily wept louder. She wanted her doll. She wanted her friend.
A grown-up heard Lily. She came to the garden. She saw Lily weeping. She saw Ben hiding.
""What is wrong, Lily?"" the grown-up asked.
""Ben took my doll. He traded it for his car. He hid it. I want my doll,"" Lily sobbed.
The grown-up frowned. She went to Ben. She found the doll behind the bush.
""Ben, that is not nice. You should not take Lily's doll. You should not trade without asking. You should not hide things. You should say sorry,"" the grown-up said.
Ben felt bad. He knew he was wrong. He gave the doll back to Lily.
""I am sorry, Lily. I was mean. Can we be friends again?"" he said.
Lily smiled. She hugged her doll. She hugged Ben.
""I forgive you, Ben. We can be friends again. But next time, ask before you trade,"" she said.
The grown-up smiled. She was glad they made up. She gave them a cookie each.
They ate the cookies. They played with their toys. They shared and took turns. They were happy."
"Tom and Sue were friends who liked to play in the big house. The big house had many rooms and doors and stairs. One day, they found a new door that was locked. They wanted to see what was inside.
""Maybe there is a treasure or a toy or a cake,"" Tom said.
""Or maybe there is a monster or a trap or a ghost,"" Sue said.
They looked for a key, but they could not find one. Then they saw a hole in the wall. It was big enough for them to crawl through.
""Let's go in and see,"" Tom said.
""I don't know, it looks dark and scary,"" Sue said.
But Tom was curious and brave, so he went in first. Sue followed him, because she did not want to be alone. They crawled through the hole and came out in a big chamber. It was dark and cold and dusty. There were many things in the chamber, but they were old and broken and dirty.
""This is not fun, this is boring,"" Tom said.
""Let's go back,"" Sue said.
But when they turned around, they saw that the hole was gone. It was covered by a big stone that fell from the ceiling. They were trapped in the chamber. They were helpless.
""Help! Help!"" they shouted, but no one heard them.
They cried and hugged each other. They wished they had not gone in the chamber. They wished they had listened to Sue. They were sorry for being naughty and curious.
Then they heard a sound. It was a voice. It was coming from a small window in the wall.
""Hello, hello, are you there?"" the voice said.
It was their friend Ben. He had seen them go in the hole and followed them. He had seen the stone fall and blocked the hole. He had looked for another way to get to them. He had found the window.
""Ben, Ben, we are here, we are here!"" Tom and Sue said.
""Don't worry, I will help you,"" Ben said.
He ran to get a rope and a flashlight. He came back and threw the rope through the window. He told Tom and Sue to tie it around their waists. He pulled them out one by one. He gave them the flashlight and hugged them.
""Are you okay? Are you hurt?"" he asked.
""We are okay, we are okay, thanks to you,"" Tom and Sue said.
They were happy and grateful. They thanked Ben for saving them. They said they were sorry for being foolish and reckless. They said they learned their lesson. They said they would never go in the chamber again. They said they would always listen to their friend.
Ben smiled and said, ""You are welcome. I am glad you are safe. You are my friends. Friends help each other. Friends solve problems together. Friends are good.""
The end."
"Lily and Sam were playing with their trucks in the backyard. They liked to make noises and pretend they were driving on the road. Lily had a red truck and Sam had a blue truck.
""Look at my truck, it is so fast and strong!"" Sam said, zooming his truck on the grass.
""My truck is faster and stronger!"" Lily said, chasing Sam's truck with her own.
They raced and bumped their trucks until they reached the fence. There, they saw a big sign that said ""Lemonade for sale"". It was made by their neighbor, Ben, who had a table with a pitcher and some cups.
""Let's go get some lemonade, I am thirsty!"" Sam said, leaving his truck by the fence.
""Me too!"" Lily said, following Sam with her truck.
They ran to the table and saw Ben smiling. He had a big yellow hat and a green apron.
""Hi, Lily and Sam! Do you want some lemonade? It is only one penny a cup!"" Ben said, holding a cup.
""Yes, please!"" Lily and Sam said, giving Ben a penny each.
Ben poured them some lemonade and handed them the cups. Lily and Sam took a sip and made a face. The lemonade was very sour!
""Yuck! This lemonade is sour!"" Lily said, spitting it out.
""Me too! It is not good!"" Sam said, putting down his cup.
Ben looked sad. He had worked hard to make the lemonade, but he had put too much lemon and not enough sugar.
""I'm sorry, Lily and Sam. I wanted to make good lemonade, but I guess I made a mistake. Do you want your pennies back?"" Ben said, reaching for his jar.
Lily and Sam looked at each other. They felt sorry for Ben. He was their friend and he had tried his best.
""No, Ben, it's okay. You can keep the pennies. Maybe you can try again another day."" Lily said, smiling.
""Yeah, Ben, don't be sad. We still like you and your sign. It is very nice. You can display it again when you make better lemonade."" Sam said, pointing at the sign.
Ben smiled back. He was glad that Lily and Sam were nice and did not get mad at him.
""Thank you, Lily and Sam. You are good friends. Do you want to play with me and my truck? I have a yellow truck that matches my hat."" Ben said, showing them his truck.
""Sure, Ben, we would love to play with you and your truck. Let's go to the backyard and have some fun!"" Lily said, grabbing her truck.
""Come on, Ben, let's go!"" Sam said, picking up his truck.
They ran to the backyard, leaving the sour lemonade behind. They played with their trucks and had a good time. They forgot about the lemonade and were happy."
"Ben and Mia love to swim in the sea. They have big masks and tubes to see the fish. One day, they see a big boat near the shore. The boat has many boxes on it.
""Let's go see the boat,"" Ben says. ""Maybe they have something fun.""
""OK,"" Mia says. ""But we have to be careful. The boat might be bad.""
They swim to the boat and look at the boxes. They see words on them. They do not know what they mean. They see a hole in one box. They peek inside. They see many shiny things.
""Wow,"" Ben says. ""These are pretty. Can we take some?""
""I don't know,"" Mia says. ""Maybe they belong to someone.""
They hear a loud voice from the boat. It is a man. He is angry.
""Hey, you kids! Get away from there! That's my supply of jewels! I stole them from the reef! They are very valuable!""
Ben and Mia are scared. They drop the shiny things and swim away. The man tries to catch them, but he is too slow. He is crazy.
Ben and Mia reach the shore. They are safe. They hug each other.
""That was scary,"" Ben says. ""We should not go near the boat again.""
""Yes,"" Mia says. ""The boat is bad. The man is bad. The shiny things are bad. They hurt the reef and the fish.""
They decide to swim in another place. They find a nice reef with many colors and shapes. They see many friendly fish. They are happy. They forget about the boat and the crazy man. They have fun."
"Lily and Tom were friends who liked to play with loops. Loops were round things that you could roll, spin, or wear. They had many loops of different colors and sizes. One day, they received a big box from their aunt. Inside the box, there were many new loops that they had never seen before.
""Wow, look at these loops!"" Lily said. ""They are so shiny and pretty. Can we play with them?""
""Of course we can!"" Tom said. ""Let's see what they can do.""
They opened the box and took out the loops. Some of the loops had bells, some had beads, some had ribbons, and some had lights. They tried to roll, spin, and wear the loops, but they did not work well. The bells made too much noise, the beads fell off, the ribbons got tangled, and the lights hurt their eyes.
""These loops are not fun,"" Lily said. ""They are too different from our old loops. I want to play with our old loops.""
""Me too,"" Tom said. ""Let's put these loops back in the box and play with our old loops.""
They put the new loops back in the box and went to look for their old loops. But they could not find them. They looked everywhere, but they were gone.
""Where are our old loops?"" Lily asked. ""Did someone take them?""
""Maybe the aunt took them,"" Tom said. ""Maybe she wanted to trade them for the new loops.""
""That's not fair!"" Lily said. ""We did not want to trade our old loops. We liked our old loops. They were our favorite loops.""
They started to cry. They wished they had not opened the box. They wished they had not played with the new loops. They wished they had kept their old loops.
The moral of the story is: Be careful what you wish for. Sometimes, the things that seem new and exciting are not as good as the things that you already have. You should appreciate what you have and not be greedy for what you don't."
"Tom and Jen like to play with their toy cars. They have a big stadium where they can race and crash their cars. They pretend they are drivers and fans and make loud noises.
One day, Tom's car breaks. The wheel falls off and the car stops. Tom is sad and angry. He throws his car on the floor and cries.
""Tom, don't cry,"" Jen says. ""We can fix your car. I have glue and tape. Come, let's go to the table and fix it.""
Tom and Jen go to the table and find the glue and tape. Jen puts some glue on the wheel and sticks it back to the car. Then she wraps some tape around it to make it stronger.
""There, your car is fixed,"" Jen says. ""Let's go back to the stadium and race again.""
Tom smiles and hugs Jen. He is happy and thankful. He picks up his car and runs to the stadium. He and Jen race and crash their cars again. They have fun and forget about the scary broken car. They are good friends."
"Ben and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to swing, slide and run. But they also liked to look for bugs. They had a jar with holes in the lid. They put some grass and leaves in the jar. Then they searched for bugs to put in the jar.
""Look, Lily, I found a green bug!"" Ben said. He showed Lily a small beetle with shiny green wings. ""It is so pretty! Can we keep it?""
Lily nodded. She liked the green bug too. She opened the jar and Ben put the bug inside. They closed the lid and shook the jar gently. The bug crawled on the grass and leaves.
""Let's find more bugs!"" Lily said. She ran to a flower bed and looked for more bugs. Ben followed her.
They found a red bug, a yellow bug, a black bug and a blue bug. They put them all in the jar. They were happy. They had a lot of bugs.
But then they heard a loud buzz. A big bee flew near them. It saw the jar with the bugs. It wanted to see the bugs too. It flew to the jar and tried to get in. It pushed the lid with its head.
""Go away, bee!"" Ben said. He waved his hand at the bee. ""These are our bugs! You can't have them!""
But the bee did not go away. It was angry. It stung Ben on his lip. Ben cried out. His lip hurt. It was red and swollen.
Lily saw Ben's lip. She felt sorry for him. She hugged him. She said, ""I'm sorry, Ben. The bee was mean. Let's go to mom. She will make your lip better.""
Ben nodded. He held Lily's hand. They took the jar with the bugs. They ran to their mom. She was sitting on a bench. She saw Ben's lip. She said, ""Oh, Ben, what happened? Did a bee sting you?""
Ben nodded. He said, ""Yes, mom. The bee wanted our bugs. We found a lot of bugs. Look, mom, we have a green bug!""
Mom smiled. She said, ""You have a lot of bugs. They are very pretty. But you have to be careful with bees. They can sting you. Let me see your lip.""
Mom took a tissue and put some ice on Ben's lip. She said, ""This will make your lip feel better. It will go down soon. Don't worry.""
Ben felt better. He said, ""Thank you, mom. You are the best.""
Mom said, ""You're welcome, Ben. You are very brave. Now, why don't you and Lily settle on the grass and watch your bugs? Maybe they will do something funny.""
Ben and Lily settled on the grass. They watched their bugs. They saw the green bug fly, the red bug crawl, the yellow bug jump, the black bug hide and the blue bug shine. They laughed. They were happy. They forgot about the bee. They had fun with their bugs."
"Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play together. Today, Tom goes to visit Mia at her house. He brings his toy car and his hat.
""Hi, Tom!"" Mia says. ""Do you want to play with me?""
""Yes, please!"" Tom says. He puts his hat on the table and his car on the floor. ""What do you want to play?""
Mia thinks for a moment. She has an idea. ""Let's play tea party!"" she says. She takes two cups and a pitcher from her toy box. She fills the pitcher with juice. ""This is our tea,"" she says.
Tom nods. He likes juice. He takes a cup and holds it out. Mia pours some juice into his cup. ""Thank you,"" Tom says. He takes a sip. The juice is sweet and cold.
Mia pours some juice into her cup, too. She raises it to her lips. But then, she sneezes. Achoo! The juice spills out of her cup and onto her dress. She gasps. Her dress is wet and sticky.
""Oh, no!"" Tom says. He puts his cup down and gets a napkin. He tries to help Mia wipe the juice off her dress. But the napkin is too small. The juice makes a big stain.
Mia starts to cry. She does not like her wet dress. She feels sad and messy.
""Don't cry, Mia,"" Tom says. He hugs her. ""It's okay. It was an accident. You can change your dress.""
Mia sniffles. She looks at Tom. He is a good friend. He makes her feel better. She hugs him back. ""Thank you, Tom,"" she says. ""You are very nice.""
Tom smiles. He is happy to help Mia. He likes to play with her. He does not mind the juice. He thinks it is funny. He laughs. ""You're welcome, Mia,"" he says. ""You are very nice, too."""
"Anna liked to wake up early and watch the sunrise. She liked how the sky changed colors and how the birds sang. She liked to sit on the window and feel the warm sun on her face. But she was lonely. She wished she had someone to share the sunrise with.
One day, she saw a boy walking on the street. He had a big backpack and a funny hat. He looked up and saw Anna on the window. He smiled and waved at her. Anna smiled and waved back. She felt happy. She wanted to talk to him.
She ran to the door and opened it. She called out to the boy. ""Hi! What is your name? Do you want to see the sunrise with me?""
The boy stopped and looked at her. He said, ""Hi! My name is Ben. I am going to school. I like the sunrise, but I have to mind the time. I don't want to be late.""
Anna felt sad. She said, ""Oh. I don't go to school. I stay at home with my mom. She is sick and needs me. I don't have any friends. I am lonely.""
Ben felt sorry for her. He said, ""I am sorry. That is hard. I have an idea. Why don't you come with me to school? You can meet my friends and learn new things. Maybe you will like it. And you can still see the sunrise on the way.""
Anna liked the idea. She said, ""Yes, please. That sounds fun. Thank you, Ben. You are very kind. Can I bring my mom?""
Ben said, ""Of course. She can come too. Maybe she will feel better. Come on, let's go. The sunrise is waiting for us.""
Anna and Ben held hands and walked to school. They saw the sunrise together. They saw the sky change colors and heard the birds sing. They felt the warm sun on their faces. They were not lonely anymore. They were happy. They had found a friend."
"Anna and Ben are playing in the park. They see a large dog with brown fur and a red bow on its neck. The dog is friendly and wags its tail.
""Hello, dog!"" Anna says. ""You are very pretty. Can I pet you?""
The dog nods and licks Anna's hand. Ben is scared of the dog. He hides behind a tree.
""Ben, don't be afraid,"" Anna says. ""The dog is nice. Come and say hi.""
Ben shakes his head. He does not want to go near the dog. He sees a shiny purse on the bench. The purse is pink and has flowers on it.
""Look, Anna, a purse!"" Ben says. ""Maybe it has something inside.""
Ben runs to the bench and grabs the purse. He opens it and finds a cookie, a ball, and a whistle.
""Wow, this is a great purse!"" Ben says. ""I want to keep it.""
The dog barks and runs after Ben. The dog wants the purse too. The dog jumps on Ben and knocks him down. The purse falls on the ground and the cookie, the ball, and the whistle roll out.
""Hey, stop it!"" Ben cries. ""This is my purse!""
The dog picks up the cookie with its mouth and eats it. The dog also plays with the ball and the whistle.
""Bad dog!"" Ben says. ""Give me back my things!""
Anna comes to help Ben. She sees a lady running towards them. The lady is wearing a blue dress and a hat. The lady is the owner of the dog and the purse.
""Spot, come here!"" the lady says. ""I'm sorry, kids, he took my purse. He likes to chew on things.""
The lady takes the purse and the whistle from the dog. She gives the ball to Ben and the cookie to Anna.
""Here, you can have these,"" the lady says. ""I'm sorry for the trouble. Spot is a good dog, but he is very curious.""
The lady puts the bow back on the dog's neck and walks away. The dog wags its tail and says goodbye.
""Bye, dog!"" Anna says. ""You are very funny. Thank you for the cookie.""
Ben is still angry. He does not like the dog. He does not like the ball. He wants the purse.
""Anna, let's go home,"" Ben says. ""I don't want to play here anymore.""
Anna nods and follows Ben. She likes the cookie. She likes the dog. She thinks the purse is too big for her. She is happy."
"Lily and Ben were excited to go to the lake with their dad. They liked to swim, splash and play with the fish. They also liked to find logs and sticks to make boats and rafts.
""Look, dad, I found a big log!"" Ben shouted, dragging a long piece of wood to the shore. ""Can we make a boat with it?""
""Sure, Ben, that's a great log for a boat. Let's see if we can find some rope and a sail,"" dad said, smiling.
Lily ran to help Ben with the log. She saw a blue towel and a stick nearby. ""I have an idea, Ben. We can use this towel as a sail and this stick as a mast. Then we can tie them to the log with this rope,"" she said, holding up the items.
""Wow, Lily, you are very smart. That's a good idea. Let's do it,"" Ben said, nodding.
They worked together to make the boat. They tied the rope around the log and the stick. They attached the towel to the stick with some knots. They made sure the boat was strong and stable.
""Are you ready, Ben?"" Lily asked, holding the boat.
""Yes, I'm ready, Lily. Let's send our boat to the water,"" Ben said, grabbing the other end of the boat.
They lifted the boat and carried it to the edge of the lake. They counted to three and pushed the boat into the water. The boat floated and the wind blew the sail.
""Look, dad, look! Our boat is sailing!"" Lily and Ben shouted, jumping and clapping.
""Wow, you two, you made a wonderful boat. I'm very proud of you. Let's watch it go,"" dad said, hugging them."
"Sara likes to read books. She has many books in her room. She reads them every day. She reads about animals, and cars, and stars.
One day, Sara finds a new book in her room. It is a big book with a shiny cover. She opens it and sees many pictures. She sees a picture of a chain. A chain is a long thing with many round parts. She reads the words under the picture. The words say: ""A chain can be used to pull, to lock, or to make noise.""
Sara wants to try the chain. She looks around her room. She sees her toy box. She sees a lock on her toy box. She thinks: ""Maybe I can use the chain to open the lock."" She takes the chain and puts it around the lock. She pulls the chain hard. The lock does not open. She pulls harder. The lock still does not open. She pulls harder and harder. The chain breaks. The lock falls to the floor. Sara is sad. She says: ""Oh no, I broke the chain. Now I can't read the book anymore.""
Sara hears a noise. She turns around. She sees her mom. Her mom is smiling. She says: ""Sara, what are you doing? I brought you a new book. It is a book about chains. I thought you would like it."" Sara is surprised. She says: ""Mom, this is the book I was reading. I found it in my room. I tried to use the chain to open the lock, but I broke the chain. I'm sorry, mom."" Her mom hugs her. She says: ""It's okay, Sara. The chain was old and weak. It was not a good chain. I have a new chain for you. It is a strong chain. You can use it to play, but not to open locks. And you can still read the book. The book is not broken. It is a good book. I love you, Sara."" Sara smiles. She says: ""I love you too, mom. Thank you for the book and the chain. Can we read the book together?"" Her mom says: ""Of course, Sara. Let's read the book together. It is a warm day. We can read the book in the garden. Come on, Sara. Let's go."" Sara takes the book and the chain. She follows her mom. She is happy. She likes to read books. She likes to learn new things. She likes to be with her mom."
"Anna liked to play with her cute doll. She named her doll Lily and gave her a pink dress and a hat. Anna and Lily did everything together. They had tea parties, read books, and sang songs.
One day, Anna and Lily went to the park with Mommy. Anna saw a big slide and wanted to try it. She put Lily on the grass and ran to the slide. She climbed up the ladder and slid down with a big smile. She felt happy and proud.
But when she went back to the grass, Lily was gone. Anna looked everywhere, but she could not find her doll. She felt sad and scared. She started to cry and called for Mommy.
Mommy came and hugged Anna. She asked her what was wrong. Anna told her that Lily disappeared. Mommy helped Anna look for Lily. They searched the park, but they could not see her.
Then, Mommy noticed a small crack in the fence. She peeked through the crack and saw Lily on the other side. She was lying on the dirt, next to a trash can. Mommy reached through the crack and grabbed Lily. She gave her back to Anna.
Anna was so happy to see Lily. She hugged her and kissed her. She thanked Mommy for finding her. She said she was sorry for leaving her alone. She promised to never lose her again.

"Lily liked balloons. She liked to blow them up and tie them. She liked to make them fly and bounce. She liked to play with them with her friends.
But Max did not like balloons. He was scared of them. He thought they were loud and mean. He did not like to see them or touch them. He hated when Lily played with them.
One day, Lily brought a big red balloon to school. She was very happy. She showed it to her friends and they smiled. But Max saw the balloon and he was very worried. He wanted the balloon to go away.
He had an idea. He found a sharp stick and he hid it in his hand. He walked up to Lily and her friends. He pretended to be nice. He said hello and asked to see the balloon.
Lily was surprised. She did not know Max wanted to play. She was kind and she gave him the balloon. She hoped he would like it.
But Max did not like it. He held the balloon and he poked it with the stick. The balloon popped with a loud bang. Lily and her friends screamed and jumped. Max laughed and ran away.
Lily was very sad. She liked her balloon and she wanted to play with it. She did not understand why Max did that. She felt angry and hurt. She cried and hugged her friends.
Max was not happy. He thought he would feel better after he popped the balloon. But he did not. He felt guilty and mean. He saw Lily crying and he felt sorry. He wished he did not poke the balloon. He wished he was nice."
"Sara and Ben like to play outside. But today, the sky is gray and the rain is falling. Sara and Ben are sad. They want to have fun.
They look for a place to play. They see a big tree. The tree has many leaves. The leaves keep the rain away. Sara and Ben run to the tree. They find a hole under the tree. The hole is hidden by the roots. Sara and Ben crawl into the hole.
Inside the hole, Sara and Ben are happy. They have a secret place. They can play and talk and laugh. They do not care about the rain. They keep each other warm and cozy. They pretend they are animals or pirates or fairies. They have many stories to tell.

Anna likes dogs. She nods and smiles. She walks to the lady and the dog. She pauses. She is a little scared. The dog is bigger than her.

One day, Sara and Ben see a big truck outside their house. It has many cans of paint and brushes. A man gets out of the truck. He is a painter. He comes to their door and talks to Mommy. He says he will paint their house a new color. Mommy says yes and shows him the house.

"Lily was a little girl who liked to play dress-up. She had many clothes and hats and shoes in her big sack. She liked to pretend she was a princess or a fairy or a doctor. One day, she found a veil in her sack. It was white and shiny and had flowers on it. Lily put it on her head and felt very pretty.
She wanted to show her veil to her friends. She ran outside with her sack and her veil. She saw Anna and Ben playing with a ball. She called them and said, ""Look at my veil! Isn't it lovely?"" Anna and Ben looked at her and smiled. They said, ""Yes, it is very lovely. Can we try it on?"" Lily said, ""No, it is mine. You can't have it."" She hugged her sack and her veil and ran away.
She saw Tom and Mia playing with a doll. She called them and said, ""Look at my veil! Isn't it wonderful?"" Tom and Mia looked at her and nodded. They said, ""Yes, it is very wonderful. Can we see it?"" Lily said, ""No, it is mine. You can't touch it."" She hugged her sack and her veil and ran away.
She saw Sam and Zoe playing with a puzzle. She called them and said, ""Look at my veil! Isn't it amazing?"" Sam and Zoe looked at her and frowned. They said, ""Yes, it is very amazing. But why are you so mean? You don't want to share with anyone. You are not a good friend."" Lily said, ""No, you are not good friends. You want to take my veil. It is mine. You can't have it."" She hugged her sack and her veil and ran away.
She ran and ran until she reached a big tree. She sat under the tree and looked at her veil. She felt very lonely and sad. She wished she had someone to play with. She wished she had someone to tell her how pretty she was. She wished she had someone to hug her and make her happy. She realized she had been very selfish and rude. She had hurt her friends' feelings. She had been fearful of losing her veil, but she had lost something more important: her friends.
She decided to go back and say sorry to her friends. She hoped they would forgive her and play with her again. She put her veil back in her sack and ran back to where she had seen them. She saw them playing together and having fun. She felt very sorry and ashamed. She went to them and said, ""I am sorry, friends. I was very mean and silly. I don't want to keep my veil to myself. I want to share it with you. You can try it on and see how lovely you are. You can play with it and have fun. You are more precious to me than my veil. Will you be my friends again?"" Her friends looked at her and smiled. They said, ""We are happy you are sorry, Lily. We forgive you and we love you. You are a good friend. We are glad you want to share your veil with us. It is very kind of you. You are very lovely, too. Come and play with us."" They hugged her and took turns wearing the veil. They played and laughed and had a good time. Lily felt very happy and grateful. She learned that sharing is caring and that friends are more valuable than things."
"Sara and Ben like to watch videos on the big screen. They have many videos of animals, songs and stories. Sometimes they share the videos, and sometimes they want different ones.
One day, Sara wants to watch a video of a princess, but Ben wants to watch a video of a dinosaur. They both grab the same video and pull hard. The video tears in half and makes a loud noise. Sara and Ben start to cry.
Mom hears the noise and comes to see what happened. She sees the broken video and the sad children. She is not happy. She says, ""Sara and Ben, you should not tear the video. That is not nice. You should be modest and take turns. Now you cannot watch any video today. Go to your rooms and think about what you did.""
Sara and Ben feel sorry. They say, ""We are sorry, Mom. We did not mean to tear the video. We just wanted to watch it. Can we say sorry to each other and hug?""
Mom smiles and says, ""That is a good idea. You can say sorry and hug, and then you can play with your toys. Maybe tomorrow you can watch a new video, if you are modest and share.""
Sara and Ben say sorry and hug. They go to their rooms and play with their toys. They learn to be modest and share. They are happy again."
"Tim and Sam are friends. They like to watch cartoons on TV. They sit on the couch and talk about the cartoons.
""Look, Sam, it's the dog and the cat!"" Tim says. ""They are funny. The dog is big and the cat is small.""
""Yes, Tim, they are funny. The dog is silly and the cat is smart."" Sam says. ""They always chase each other and make noises.""
They laugh and clap their hands. They watch the cartoons for a long time.
Then, Tim's mom comes in. She sees Tim and Sam on the couch. She sees the TV. She is not happy.
""Tim, Sam, you have watched enough cartoons. It's time to go outside and play."" She says. ""You need some sun and fresh air. You look pale.""
Tim and Sam do not want to go outside. They want to watch more cartoons. They make sad faces.
""But mom, we like the cartoons. They are fun. Can we watch a little more?"" Tim says.
""No, Tim, you can't. You have watched too much. You need to move and run and jump. That's good for you."" She says. ""Come on, put on your shoes and jackets. I'll take you to the park. You can play with other kids and have fun.""
Tim and Sam sigh. They turn off the TV. They put on their shoes and jackets. They follow Tim's mom to the car. They hope they can watch more cartoons later."
"Jill and Ben like to play in the park. They see a big slide and run to it. Jill goes first. She climbs up the steps and sits on the slide. She slides down fast and laughs. Ben follows her. He slides down too and smiles.
They see a man with a big pink balloon. The balloon is filled with gas. The man gives the balloon to Jill and Ben. They say thank you and hold the balloon. The balloon is light and floats in the air.
They want to play with the balloon. They try to balance the balloon on their heads, their hands, and their feet. They giggle and have fun. But the wind is strong. It blows the balloon away from them. They chase the balloon. They run and jump and try to catch it.
But the balloon flies higher and higher. It goes over the trees and the houses. Jill and Ben can't reach it. They stop and look at the balloon. They feel sad. They lose their balloon.
They go back to the slide. They slide down again and again. They forget about the balloon. They have fun. They are happy."
"Lily liked to create things with her crayons and paper. She made pictures of flowers, stars, and animals. One day, she wanted to create something new. She looked at a book and saw a picture of a shrimp. It was pink and had many legs and a long tail. Lily thought it looked funny and cute.
She took a pink crayon and started to draw a shrimp on her paper. She gave it big eyes, a smile, and some dots. She was happy with her creation. She showed it to her mom and said, ""Look, mom, I made a shrimp!""
Mom smiled and said, ""That's very nice, Lily. What is your shrimp's name?""
Lily thought for a moment and said, ""His name is Bob. He is a friendly shrimp.""
Mom nodded and said, ""That's a good name. Do you want to hang your shrimp on the fridge?""
Lily nodded and said, ""Yes, please. I want everyone to see Bob.""
Mom helped Lily to hang her shrimp on the fridge with a magnet. Lily was proud of her shrimp. She said, ""Bye, Bob. I'll see you later.""
But when Lily came back from playing outside, she saw that her shrimp was gone. She looked around and saw her brother, Tom, holding her paper. He had torn it into pieces and was laughing. He said, ""Your shrimp is silly and ugly. I don't like it. I made it better.""
Lily felt sad and angry. She said, ""No, you didn't. You ruined it. That was my shrimp. His name was Bob. He was friendly. You are mean and fierce. Give me back my shrimp.""
Tom said, ""No, I won't. It's mine now. Go away.""
Lily ran to mom and told her what Tom did. Mom was not happy. She said, ""Tom, that was not nice. You should not take and destroy Lily's things. You should apologize and make it up to her.""
Tom said, ""But I don't like her shrimp. It's stupid.""
Mom said, ""It doesn't matter if you like it or not. It was her creation. She worked hard on it and she loved it. You should respect her feelings and her work. How would you feel if someone did that to your things?""
Tom thought for a while and realized that he would feel bad if someone did that to his things. He said, ""I'm sorry, Lily. I was wrong. I shouldn't have taken and torn your shrimp. Can I help you make a new one?""
Lily said, ""It's okay, Tom. I forgive you. Yes, you can help me make a new one. Maybe we can make a friend for Bob.""
Tom said, ""Okay, let's do that. What should we name him?""
Lily said, ""How about Tim?""
Tom said, ""That sounds good. Let's go get some crayons and paper.""
Mom smiled and said, ""That's very nice of you, Tom. I'm proud of you. And I'm proud of you, Lily. You are very creative and kind. You both learned a valuable lesson today. You should always treat others the way you want to be treated.""
The end."
"Tim and Lily were playing in the park with their ball. They liked to kick the ball to each other and run after it. Sometimes they missed the ball and it rolled away. They had to be careful not to lose the ball or hit someone with it.
One time, the ball went too far and landed near a lady who was sitting on a bench. She had a big hat and a book. She looked up and saw the ball. She smiled and picked it up.
""Hello, children,"" she said. ""Is this your ball?""
""Yes, it is,"" Tim said. ""We are sorry. We did not mean to bother you.""
""That's all right,"" the lady said. ""You can have your ball back. But please be careful where you kick it. There are other people and animals in the park. You don't want to hurt them or make them angry.""
""OK, we will,"" Lily said. ""Thank you, lady.""
The lady gave them the ball and they said goodbye. They ran back to their spot and decided to play a different game. They agreed to settle for catch instead of kick. They threw the ball to each other and caught it with their hands. They had fun and were careful not to let the ball go too far again. They liked the lady and hoped to see her again."
"Ben and Lily were playing with their toy cars in the garden. They liked to make them zoom on the grass and the dirt. They had many cars of different colors and sizes.
""Look at my orange car!"" Ben said. ""It is very fast and loud. Zoom, zoom, zoom!""
Lily looked at Ben's car and wanted to play with it. She reached out her hand and grabbed it. ""I want to play with the orange car!"" she said.
Ben was angry. He did not like to share his car. He pulled it back and shouted. ""No, it is my car! You have your own car. Give it back!""
Lily was angry too. She did not want to give back the car. She held it tight and cried. ""No, it is mine now! You have many cars. I only have one!""
They both started to tug and yell. They did not hear their mom calling them from the house.
""Ben, Lily, what is going on?"" mom said. She came to the garden and saw them fighting over the car. She was not happy. She took the car from them and put it on the table. ""You two need to learn to share and be nice. No one can play with the car until you say sorry to each other.""
Ben and Lily looked at each other. They felt bad for making mom angry and for hurting each other. They said sorry and hugged. Mom smiled and gave them a hug too. She gave them each a cookie and a glass of milk. She said they could play with the car together if they promised to take turns and be kind.
Ben and Lily agreed. They thanked mom and went back to the garden. They played with the car and their other toys. They made them zoom and laugh. They were happy and had fun."
"Lily was very happy today. She was going to do a great class with her friends. The class was about animals. Lily loved animals. She had a dog at home. His name was Spot.
She put on her pink dress and her shoes. She took her backpack and her lunch box. She said bye to her mom and dad. They gave her a hug and a kiss. They said, ""Have fun, Lily. Learn a lot. We are proud of you.""
Lily got on the bus with her friends. They sang songs and played games. They were very excited. They saw the teacher waiting for them at the zoo. The teacher smiled and said, ""Hello, children. Welcome to the animal class. Today we are going to see and learn about many different animals. Are you ready?""
The children said, ""Yes, teacher. We are ready."" They followed the teacher to the first cage. They saw a big lion. He had a mane and sharp teeth. He roared loudly. The children were scared. They hid behind the teacher. The teacher said, ""Don't worry, children. The lion can't hurt you. He is behind the bars. He is just saying hello. Can you say hello to the lion?""
Lily was brave. She stepped forward and said, ""Hello, lion. You are very big and strong. But I am not afraid of you. I have a dog at home. He is my friend. He barks and wags his tail. Do you have a friend, lion?"" The lion looked at Lily and blinked. He stopped roaring. He licked his paw and rubbed his head. He seemed to like Lily. He nodded and said, ""Yes, I have a friend. She is a lioness. She is in the next cage. She is very beautiful and smart. She hunts and plays with me. We are happy together."" Lily smiled and said, ""That's great, lion. I'm happy for you. Can I see your friend?"" The lion said, ""Of course. Come with me. I'll show you."" He walked to the next cage and called his friend. The lioness came and greeted Lily and the other children. They were amazed and curious. They asked the lion and the lioness many questions. They learned a lot about them. They thanked them and said goodbye. They went to see the other animals. They had a great time. They did a great class. Lily was very happy. She made a new friend. She couldn't wait to tell her mom and dad. She thought, ""This is the best day ever."""
"Lily and Ben were playing in the tent in the backyard. They had a flashlight and some toys. They liked to pretend they were camping in the woods.
""Look, I have a bear!"" Ben said, holding up a stuffed animal. ""He is big and brown and soft.""
""I have a bunny!"" Lily said, showing her toy. ""She is small and white and cute.""
They hugged their toys and smiled. They turned on the flashlight and made shadows on the tent wall.
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise outside. It sounded like thunder. They saw a flash of light. It was lightning.
Lily and Ben were scared. They dropped their toys and held each other. The flashlight flickered and went out. It was dark and noisy.
""Mommy! Daddy!"" they cried. ""Help us!""
Their parents heard them and ran to the tent. They opened the flap and saw their children crying.
""Shh, it's okay, we're here,"" Mommy said, hugging them. ""It's just a storm. It will pass soon.""
Daddy picked up the flashlight and shook it. It didn't work.
""Sorry, kids, this flashlight is cheap. It broke,"" he said. ""But don't worry, we have another one in the house. Come on, let's go inside and have some hot chocolate.""
Lily and Ben nodded. They grabbed their toys and followed their parents. They felt better when they saw the lights and felt the warmth of the house.
They still didn't like the storm, but they knew they were safe and loved."
"Lily was sick. She had a bad cough and a sore throat. She did not want to play or eat. She only wanted to sleep. Her mom was worried. She gave Lily a pill to make her feel better. But Lily did not like the pill. It was big and bitter. She spit it out.
""Please, Lily, you have to take the pill,"" her mom said. ""It will help you get well soon.""
""No, no, no!"" Lily cried. ""I don't want the pill. It's yucky!""
Her mom tried to be patient. She hugged Lily and said, ""I know, sweetie, but it's good for you. How about this? If you take the pill, I will let you watch your favorite show. The one with the lovely princess and the funny dragon. You love that show, don't you?""
Lily thought for a moment. She did love that show. It always made her laugh and smile. She wanted to see the princess and the dragon. Maybe the pill was not so bad after all. She nodded and said, ""Okay, mom, I will take the pill. But only if you let me watch the show.""
Her mom smiled and said, ""Deal."" She gave Lily a glass of water and the pill. Lily swallowed the pill quickly and made a face. Then she ran to the couch and turned on the TV. Her mom joined her and cuddled with her. They watched the show together and laughed and smiled. Lily felt a little better. She was glad she took the pill. And she was glad her mom let her watch the show. She loved her mom very much."
"Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play with toys and eat snacks. One day, they go to Lily's house after school. Lily's mom gives them tuna sandwiches and apple juice. They are happy and say thank you.
They take their sandwiches and juice to Lily's room. They see many toys on the floor. They see dolls, cars, blocks, and books. They want to play with everything. They forget about their sandwiches and juice. They leave them on the table.
They play for a long time. They make stories with the dolls and cars. They build towers with the blocks. They look at the pictures in the books. They have fun and laugh.
Then, they hear a noise. They turn around and see Lily's cat. The cat is on the table. The cat is eating their sandwiches and juice. The cat likes tuna. The cat does not like apple juice. The cat spills the juice on the floor.
Lily and Tom are surprised. They say, ""Oh no! The cat ate our sandwiches and juice! We forgot to eat them! We were too busy playing!""
Lily's mom hears them. She comes to Lily's room. She sees the cat, the sandwiches, the juice, and the mess. She is not angry. She is kind. She says, ""Don't worry, kids. It's okay. The cat was hungry too. I can make you more sandwiches and juice. But first, let's clean up the mess together.""
Lily and Tom say, ""Okay, mom. We are sorry. We will help you. And we will remember to eat our sandwiches and juice next time.""
They clean up the mess with Lily's mom. They wash their hands. They eat their new sandwiches and juice. They are full and happy. They thank Lily's mom. They hug the cat. The cat purrs. They are friends."
"Tom and Mia are friends. They like to play outside. But today, it is rain. Rain is wet and cold. They cannot go out.
""Rain, rain, go away. Come again another day,"" Tom sings. He looks out the window. He sees a big puddle. He wants to jump in it.
""Mia, look! A puddle! Let's go out and splash!"" Tom says.
""No, Tom. We cannot go out. Mom said so. We will get sick,"" Mia says. She has a book. She likes to read.
""Books are boring. Puddles are fun. Come on, Mia. Please,"" Tom begs.
""No, Tom. I like books. Books are quiet. Puddles are loud. And wet. And cold. No, thank you,"" Mia says.
Tom is sad. He does not want to read. He wants to play. He thinks of a plan. He gets a towel. He rubs it on his hair. He rubs it on his arms. He rubs it on his legs. He rubs it on his feet. He is dry.
""Look, Mia. I am dry. I can go out. I will not get sick,"" Tom says.
He opens the door. He runs to the puddle. He jumps in it. He splashes. He laughs.
""Tom, come back! You are wet! You will get sick!"" Mia shouts.
She drops her book. She runs to the door. She sees Tom. He is wet. He is cold. He is not laughing. He is sneezing.
""Tom, I told you so. You are sick. You need to come in. You need to get warm. You need to rest,"" Mia says.
She gets another towel. She wraps it around Tom. She rubs his hair. She rubs his arms. She rubs his legs. She rubs his feet. She is a good friend.
""Sorry, Mia. You were right. Books are better. Puddles are bad. Can you read to me?"" Tom says.
""Sure, Tom. I will read to you. But next time, listen to me. And to Mom. Rain is not for playing. Rain is for staying in,"" Mia says.
They go inside. They sit on the couch. Mia reads to Tom. Tom listens. They are quiet. They are happy. The rain goes on."
"Tim and Sam were brothers who liked to fish. They had a big pole that their dad gave them. They went to the lake with their pole and a bucket. They hoped to catch many fish and sell them at the market.
They saw a man with a loud voice and a sign that said ""Fish for sale"". He had many fish in his cart. He shouted, ""Come and buy my fresh fish! They are tasty and cheap!"" Tim and Sam wanted to sell their fish like him. They thought he was very smart and rich.
They threw their pole in the water and waited. They waited for a long time, but no fish came. They felt sad and bored. They wondered why the man had so many fish and they had none. They decided to ask him for a tip.
They walked to the man and said, ""Hello, sir. We are trying to catch fish and sell them, but we have no luck. Can you tell us your secret?""
The man looked at them and smiled. He said, ""Sure, boys. I'll tell you my secret. I don't catch fish. I buy them from the store and sell them here. It's easier and faster. Do you want to buy some?""
Tim and Sam were shocked and angry. They felt cheated and lied to. They said, ""No, thank you. We don't want your fish. You are not smart and rich. You are sneaky and bad. We will catch our own fish with our pole. Goodbye!""
They ran back to their pole and bucket. They hoped to catch a big fish and show the man. They learned a lesson that day. They learned that not everyone is honest and that fishing is hard work. But they also learned that fishing is fun and rewarding. They enjoyed their time at the lake with their pole and their bucket."
"Lily was sick. She had a bad cough and a sore throat. Mommy gave her some medicine, but Lily did not like it. It was bitter and yucky. She made a face and spit it out.
Mommy was upset. She said, ""Lily, you need to take your medicine. It will make you feel better."" She tried to give Lily the medicine again, but Lily turned her head and said, ""No, no, no!""
Lily ran away from Mommy. She wanted to play with her toys. She did not want to take the medicine. She ran to her room, but she did not see the ball on the floor. She stepped on the ball and stumbled. She fell down and hurt her knee. She cried out loud.
Mommy heard Lily cry. She ran to her room and saw Lily on the floor. She picked her up and hugged her. She said, ""Oh, Lily, are you okay? You have a boo-boo on your knee. Let me get a band-aid for you.""
Lily stopped crying. She looked at Mommy and said, ""I'm sorry, Mommy. I was naughty. I did not take my medicine. Can I have it now?"" Mommy smiled and said, ""Yes, Lily, you can have your medicine now. I'm glad you changed your mind. It will make you feel better."" She gave Lily the medicine and a glass of water. Lily drank it and made a face, but she did not spit it out.
Mommy kissed Lily and said, ""Good girl, Lily. I love you. Now, let's go to bed. You need to rest and get well."" Lily nodded and said, ""I love you too, Mommy. Thank you for the medicine and the band-aid."" Mommy tucked Lily in and turned off the light. Lily closed her eyes and fell asleep. She dreamed of happy things."
"Tom and Sam are friends. They like to play with cars and balls. One day, they find a big box in the yard. They want to make a boat with the box.
""Let's tie the box to the tree,"" Tom says. ""Then we can pretend we are sailing on the water.""
""OK,"" Sam says. He gets a rope and helps Tom tie the box to the branch. They climb inside the box and sit down.
""Look, there is land over there,"" Tom says, pointing to the fence. ""Maybe there are pirates or animals there.""
""Let's go and see,"" Sam says. He grabs a stick and pretends it is a sword. ""But be careful, it might be dangerous.""
They jump out of the box and run to the fence. They see a pale girl sitting on the grass. She has a doll and a book. She looks sad and lonely.
""Hi,"" Tom says. ""Who are you?""
""I'm Lily,"" the girl says. ""I just moved here. I don't have any friends.""
""Do you want to play with us?"" Sam asks. ""We have a boat and a sword. We can have fun.""
Lily smiles and nods. She puts down her doll and book and follows Tom and Sam. They go back to the box and untie it from the tree. They push it on the ground and pretend it is a boat. They sail to different lands and have adventures. They laugh and talk and become friends."
"Sara liked to play in the attic. She found many old things there. Some were toys, some were clothes, some were books. She liked to display them on the floor and pretend they were hers.
One day, she found a big box in the corner. She opened it and saw a doll. The doll had long hair, a pretty dress and shiny shoes. Sara was happy. She took the doll out and hugged it. She wanted to display it with her other things.
But the doll was not nice. It had a mean face and sharp teeth. It bit Sara's arm and made her cry. Sara was scared and hurt. She threw the doll back in the box and ran away. She did not want to play in the attic anymore.
She went to her mom and showed her the bite. Her mom was worried and angry. She asked Sara where she got the bite. Sara told her about the doll in the attic. Her mom did not believe her. She thought Sara was lying.
She took Sara to the attic and opened the box. She wanted to see the doll. But the box was empty. There was no doll. Sara was confused and uncomfortable. She did not know where the doll went. She hoped it would not come back."
"Anna liked to sign songs with her hands. She learned sign from her friend Mia, who could not hear. Anna and Mia played together at school and taught each other new signs.
One day, Anna wanted to sign a song for her mom. She looked for her book of songs on the shelf in her room. But she could not find it. She saw that her brother Ben had taken it. He was reading it on his bed.
""Ben, give me my book!"" Anna said. ""I need it to sign a song for mom.""
""No, I want to read it,"" Ben said. ""It has nice pictures and words.""
""Please, Ben, it is my book. You are naughty to take it,"" Anna said. She tried to grab the book from Ben, but he held it tight.
They pulled and pushed the book until it ripped. They both gasped and looked at the torn pages. They felt sad and sorry.
""Mom will be mad at us,"" Ben said.
""I know. We were both naughty,"" Anna said. ""Let's say sorry to mom and to each other. And let's fix the book with tape.""
They hugged and said sorry. Then they went to find mom and told her what happened. Mom was not happy, but she was glad they were honest and kind. She helped them tape the book and hugged them.
""Can you still sign a song for me, Anna?"" mom asked.
""Yes, mom. I remember some signs. And Ben can help me,"" Anna said.
They signed a song together for mom. It was a song about saying sorry and being friends. Mom smiled and clapped. She was proud of them."
"Lila and Ben are playing in the garden. They have a big bucket of water and some cups. They pour water on the flowers, on the grass, and on each other. They laugh and splash and have fun.
""Look, Lila, I can make a big wave!"" Ben says. He fills his cup with water and throws it in the air. The water falls down on Lila's head and makes her wet.
""Hey, Ben, that's not nice!"" Lila says. She feels the water on her face and hair. She wipes her face with her hand and shakes her head. ""Now I'm all wet and cold!""
""I'm sorry, Lila, I was just playing,"" Ben says. He sees that Lila is not happy. He wants to make her smile again. He thinks of something. ""Do you want to see something funny?""
""What is it?"" Lila asks. She is curious.
Ben runs to the clothesline, where his mom hung some clothes to dry. He finds a long scarf that belongs to his dad. He wraps it around his neck and face, leaving only his eyes and nose out. He looks like a mummy. He runs back to Lila and says, ""Boo!""
Lila sees Ben and his silly scarf. She forgets that she is wet and cold. She starts to giggle. She thinks Ben looks very funny. She says, ""Ben, you look like a mummy! A mummy with a long scarf!""
Ben laughs too. He unwraps the scarf and says, ""It's not a mummy, it's me! Do you want to try it?""
Lila nods. She takes the scarf from Ben and wraps it around her neck and face. She says, ""Boo!""
They both laugh and play with the scarf. They forget about the water and the cold. They are happy and warm."
"Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play and sing. One day, they find a big hat and a long scarf in Mom's closet. They put them on and pretend to be opera singers.
""Hello, I am Sara, the best opera singer in the world!"" Sara says in a loud voice.
""And I am Ben, the most handsome opera singer in the world!"" Ben says in a loud voice.
They start to sing a song they make up. They sing very high and very low. They sing very fast and very slow. They sing very loud and very soft. They make funny faces and gestures.
Mom hears them and comes to see what they are doing. She sees them in the hat and the scarf, singing their silly song. She smiles and claps her hands.
""Bravo, bravo, you are wonderful opera singers!"" Mom says in a kind voice.
Sara and Ben stop singing and bow. They are happy that Mom likes their show. They run to hug her and say thank you.
Mom is compassionate. She loves Sara and Ben very much. She laughs with them and tells them they are very creative and funny. She says they can keep the hat and the scarf and play opera anytime they want. Sara and Ben are very happy. They love Mom very much. They laugh with her and tell her they love her too."
"Lila and Ben were friends who liked to play in the park. They had a plan to make a path with stones and sticks. They wanted to make the path go from the slide to the swings. They thought it would be fun to walk on the path and pretend they were on an adventure.
They started to look for stones and sticks on the ground. They found some big ones and some small ones. They put them in a pile near the slide. Then they began to lay them on the grass, making a line. They were happy with their plan.
But then they saw a big dog running towards them. The dog was barking and wagging its tail. It looked friendly, but Lila and Ben were scared. They did not know the dog. They did not know if it was nice or mean. They ran away from the slide and the path. They hid behind a bench.
""Go away, dog!"" Lila shouted. ""This is our path! You can't ruin it!""
The dog did not listen. It jumped on the slide and slid down. It landed on the path and knocked over some stones and sticks. It ran around the path, making a mess. It thought it was a game.
Lila and Ben were troubled. They did not like the dog. They did not like what it did to their path. They wanted it to leave. They looked for someone who could help them. They saw a lady walking with a leash. She was the dog's owner.
""Miss, miss!"" Ben called. ""Please get your dog! It is ruining our path!""
The lady heard Ben and saw the dog. She was sorry. She ran to the dog and put the leash on it. She apologized to Lila and Ben.
""I'm so sorry, kids. I didn't see you there. My dog is very playful, but he doesn't mean any harm. He just likes to have fun. I hope he didn't hurt your path too much.""
Lila and Ben looked at their path. It was not as nice as before. Some stones and sticks were out of place. Some were broken. They were sad.
""It's okay, miss,"" Lila said. ""We can fix it. We can make it better. We still have our plan.""
The lady smiled and thanked them. She walked away with the dog. Lila and Ben went back to the slide and the path. They picked up the stones and sticks. They rearranged them on the grass. They made the path go from the slide to the swings. They were happy with their plan. They walked on the path and pretended they were on an adventure."
"Tom and Lily were playing in the park. They saw a big hole in the ground. They wanted to know what was inside.
""Let's go and look,"" said Tom.
""No, it might be dangerous,"" said Lily.
But Tom did not listen. He jumped into the hole. Lily was scared. She called for Tom, but he did not answer.
Tom went deeper and deeper into the hole. It was dark and cold. He heard a loud growl. He saw a big bear. The bear was grumpy. He did not like visitors in his home.
""Who are you? What are you doing here?"" the bear roared.
Tom was very afraid. He wished he had listened to Lily. He said, ""I'm sorry, Mr. Bear. I was curious. I wanted to know what was underground. Please don't hurt me.""
The bear looked at Tom. He saw that he was a small boy. He felt sorry for him. He said, ""You are lucky, boy. I'm not hungry today. But you should not come here again. This is my home. You belong above the ground. Go back to your friend. And remember, curiosity can be dangerous.""
The bear helped Tom out of the hole. Tom ran to Lily. He hugged her and said, ""I'm sorry, Lily. You were right. I should have listened to you. I met a grumpy bear underground. He was scary, but he let me go. I learned my lesson. I will not be so curious again.""
Lily was happy that Tom was safe. She said, ""I'm glad you're okay, Tom. I forgive you. But next time, please be careful. There are many things to know and explore, but some things are better left alone.""
Tom and Lily went home. They told their parents what happened. Their parents were proud of them. They said, ""You are brave and smart, Tom and Lily. You learned a valuable lesson today. Curiosity is good, but it must be balanced with caution and respect. Knowing when to stop is also important. We love you very much."""
"Lily and Ben love to play with their toy instruments. Lily has a small drum and Ben has a tiny guitar. They pretend to be musicians and make loud noises. Sometimes they sing along, too.
One day, they decide to play in the garden. They find a huge tree with many leaves. They think it is a good place to make music. They sit under the tree and start to play. They are very happy.
But then, they hear a loud roar. They look up and see a big lion on the tree. The lion is angry and hungry. He wants to eat them. Lily and Ben are very scared. They drop their instruments and run away.
""Help! Help!"" they shout.
Their mom hears them and comes out. She sees the lion and grabs a big blanket. She throws the blanket over the lion and covers him. The lion is confused and can't see. He stops roaring and tries to get out.
""Go away, lion!"" mom says. ""You can't eat my children!""
She takes Lily and Ben by the hand and runs inside the house. She locks the door and hugs them.
""Are you okay, my loves?"" she asks.
""Yes, mom, we are okay,"" Lily and Ben say. ""Thank you for saving us!""
They are very grateful and proud of their mom. They tell her about their music and their instruments. Mom smiles and says they are very brave and creative.
""Maybe we can play music together later,"" she says. ""But first, let's have some cookies and milk.""
Lily and Ben agree. They love their mom and their music. They forget about the lion and the huge tree. They are very happy."
"Tom and Anna were twins who liked to play in the living room. They saw a big tree with shiny things on it. Mommy said the shiny things were ornaments and they were very pretty. She also said they were very fragile and they should not touch them.
But Tom and Anna were curious and wanted to see the ornaments up close. They waited until Mommy was busy in the kitchen and then they tiptoed to the tree. They reached for the ornaments and tried to take them off the branches. But the ornaments were slippery and some of them fell to the floor. They made a loud noise and broke into pieces.
Mommy heard the noise and came to the living room. She saw the broken ornaments and the mess on the floor. She was very angry and sad. She said to Tom and Anna, ""What have you done? You have destroyed the ornaments! They were very special to me. They were from Grandma and Grandpa. They are gone now and I can't fix them. You are very naughty and you have to go to your room. No more playing for you today.""
Tom and Anna felt very sorry and scared. They did not mean to destroy the ornaments. They just wanted to look at them. They said to Mommy, ""We are sorry, Mommy. We did not know they were from Grandma and Grandpa. We did not know they would break. Please don't be mad at us. We love you, Mommy.""
Mommy sighed and hugged them. She said, ""I love you too, Tom and Anna. But you have to be more careful and listen to me. The ornaments were very important to me and I can't get them back. You have to learn to respect other people's things. Now go to your room and think about what you did. Maybe later we can talk more and make some new ornaments together.""
Tom and Anna nodded and went to their room. They felt very bad and wished they had not touched the ornaments. They hoped Mommy would forgive them and they could make her happy again. They sat on their beds and were very quiet."
"Lily and Tom are twins. They like to play and have fun. They are very happy because they are going on holiday with Mum and Dad. They pack their bags and toys and get in the car.
The car goes very fast on the road. Lily and Tom look out the window and see many things. They see cows and sheep and trees and houses. They tell each other what they see and make up stories. They sing songs and laugh.
After a long time, the car stops at a big house. Mum and Dad say this is where they will stay for the holiday. They get out of the car and take their bags and toys. They go inside the house and look around. It is very nice and cosy.
But there is a problem. The house has a smelly smell. It smells like old socks and cheese and fish. Lily and Tom do not like the smell. They cover their noses and say yuck. Mum and Dad do not like the smell either. They say sorry and look for the source of the smell.
They find it in the kitchen. It is a big bin full of rubbish. Someone forgot to take it out before they left. Mum and Dad take the bin outside and throw it away. They open the windows and spray some perfume. The smell goes away and the house is fresh and clean.
Lily and Tom are happy again. They say thank you and give Mum and Dad a hug. They unpack their bags and toys and choose their rooms. They are ready to enjoy their holiday. They hope to see more cows and sheep and trees and houses. They hope to have more fun and make more stories. They hope the house does not get smelly again."
"Ben and Lily are brother and sister. They like to play together. Sometimes they play with toys, sometimes they play with books, sometimes they play with puzzles.
One day, they want to play with TV. TV is big and shiny. It has many colors and sounds. Ben and Lily like to watch TV.
But Mom says, ""No, TV is not for playing. TV is for watching. You can watch TV for a little time, but then you have to play with something else.""
Ben and Lily are sad. They want to play with TV more. They ask Mom, ""Why can't we play with TV? TV is fun. TV is nice.""
Mom says, ""TV is fun and nice, but TV is not good for you if you watch too much. TV can make your eyes tired and your brain sleepy. You need to play with other things that make your eyes happy and your brain smart. Like toys, books, puzzles, or outside.""
Ben and Lily think about it. They like to make their eyes happy and their brain smart. They say, ""OK, Mom. We will watch TV for a little time, and then we will play with other things.""
Mom smiles and says, ""Good. I love you, Ben and Lily. You are good children.""
Ben and Lily watch TV for a little time. They see animals and songs and stories. They laugh and clap and sing. Then they turn off TV and go to play with other things. They have fun. They are happy."
"Lila and her mom were in the car. They wanted to go to the zoo. Lila loved the zoo. She wanted to see the wild animals. She hoped to see the lions and the monkeys and the giraffes.
But the car was not moving. There were many cars in front of them and behind them. They were stuck in traffic. Lila was sad. She looked out the window and saw the red lights and the honking horns.
""Mom, why are we not moving?"" she asked.
""Because there is too much traffic, honey. Sometimes there are too many cars on the road and they make a big jam. We have to wait until the jam clears,"" mom said.
""How long do we have to wait?"" Lila asked.
""I don't know, honey. Maybe a few minutes, maybe a long time. It depends on how fast the cars can move,"" mom said.
Lila sighed. She did not like waiting. She wanted to go to the zoo. She hoped the traffic would go away soon. She hoped the zoo would not close before they got there. She hoped the wild animals would not be too tired or too hungry to play with her. She hoped they would have fun at the zoo. She hoped, she hoped, she hoped."
"Sara and Tom love to play with their kayak. It is brown and big and floats on the water. They like to paddle and splash and see the fish and the birds. One day, they find a small island with a lot of flowers and trees. They decide to explore it and have a picnic.
""Look, Sara, what a pretty necklace!"" Tom says, picking up a string of shells and beads. He puts it around Sara's neck and smiles. ""You are very pretty, Sara. Do you want to marry me?""
Sara giggles and nods. ""Yes, Tom, I want to marry you. You are very nice and funny. But how can we marry?""
Tom thinks for a moment. He remembers that his mom and dad had a ring and a cake and a party when they married. He looks around and sees a big leaf and a berry. He takes the leaf and makes a hole in it. He puts the berry in the hole and makes a ring. He gives it to Sara and says, ""Here, Sara, this is your ring. Now we are married.""
Sara puts the ring on her finger and hugs Tom. ""Thank you, Tom, this is a beautiful ring. Now we are married.""
They share their sandwich and juice and have a cake of cookies. They dance and sing and laugh. They are very happy. They get back in their kayak and paddle home. They tell their mom and dad that they are married. Their mom and dad smile and hug them. They are proud of their children. They say, ""You are very sweet, Sara and Tom. But you are still very young. You can play and pretend, but you are not really married. You have to grow up and learn a lot of things before you can marry. But we love you very much and we are happy that you are friends.""
Sara and Tom understand. They are not sad. They know that they are still children and have a lot of fun to have. They keep their necklace and ring and kayak. They play and pretend and dream. They are still friends. And maybe, one day, when they are big, they will marry for real."
"Sam had a watch that he liked very much. It was blue and shiny and it made a tick-tock sound. He wore it every day and showed it to his friends. He felt mighty with his watch.
One day, a man came to his house. He had a big bag full of toys and books. He said he wanted to sell them to Sam and his mom. He saw Sam's watch and said, ""What a nice watch you have! Do you want to trade it for something in my bag?""
Sam looked at the bag and saw many things that he wanted. He saw a red car, a yellow ball, a green dinosaur, a brown bear, and a big book with pictures. He thought they were all very fun and cool. He said, ""Yes, I want to trade my watch for something in your bag. What can I have?""
The man smiled and said, ""You can have anything you want, but only one thing. Choose wisely, because you can't change your mind later."" He opened the bag and let Sam see all the things inside.
Sam thought hard. He liked his watch, but he also liked the toys and books. He wanted to have them all, but he knew he had to pick one. He looked at the red car, the yellow ball, the green dinosaur, the brown bear, and the big book. He wondered which one he would play with the most. He wondered which one would make him feel mighty.
He decided to trade his watch for the big book. He liked books because they had stories and pictures that he could look at and read. He thought the book would make him learn new things and have new adventures. He said, ""I want the big book, please.""
The man nodded and said, ""Okay, here you go. Give me your watch and take the book. It's a fair trade."" He took Sam's watch and gave him the book. He said, ""Thank you, Sam. Enjoy your book. Goodbye."" He left with his bag and Sam's watch.
Sam opened the book and saw many pages with words and drawings. He felt happy and excited. He said, ""Mom, look at my book! It's so big and nice! Can you read it to me?""
His mom smiled and said, ""Sure, Sam. I'm glad you like your book. It looks very interesting. Let's sit down and read it together."" She hugged him and said, ""You are a mighty boy, Sam. You made a good choice."""
"Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play together. Today, they have a task. They have to find a beautiful flower for their teacher.
They walk in the park. They see many flowers. Some are red, some are yellow, some are pink. But they want to find the most beautiful flower of all.
They see a big hill. They think maybe there is a beautiful flower on top of the hill. They run to the hill. They jump over rocks and sticks. They climb up the hill. They are tired, but they are happy.
They reach the top of the hill. They look around. They see a big, bright, purple flower. It is the most beautiful flower they have ever seen. They smile at each other. They pick the flower. They run down the hill. They jump over rocks and sticks. They are tired, but they are happy.
They go back to their teacher. They give her the flower. She is very happy. She says they did a good job. She says they are very kind. She says the flower is beautiful. Anna and Ben are proud. They hug their teacher. They hug each other. They are friends."
"Lily liked to play the flute. She had a small flute that made pretty sounds when she blew into it. She learned how to play from her big sister, who was very good at music.
One day, Lily went to the park with her mom and her flute. She saw some other kids playing on the swings and slides. She wanted to join them, but she was shy. She held her flute close to her chest and looked at them.
""Hi, what's that?"" a boy asked her, pointing at her flute. He had curly hair and a friendly smile.
""It's a flute,"" Lily said softly.
""Can you play it?"" the boy asked.
""A little,"" Lily said.
""Can I hear it?"" the boy asked.
Lily nodded. She put the flute to her lips and played a simple tune. The boy clapped his hands and smiled.
""That was nice,"" he said. ""What's your name?""
""Lily,"" she said.
""I'm Ben,"" he said. ""Do you want to play with us?""
Lily looked at her mom, who nodded and smiled. She felt happy and brave.
""Okay,"" she said.
She followed Ben to the swings and slides. They played together and had fun. Lily made a new friend. She was glad she mentioned her flute."
"Sara and Tom are playing in the kitchen. They want to make a cake for Mom. They have a big bowl, some flour, some eggs, some milk and some sugar. They also have a spoon to stir.
""Tom, can you stir the flour and the eggs?"" Sara asks.
""OK, Sara, I can stir,"" Tom says. He takes the spoon and stirs the flour and the eggs. He stirs and stirs until they are mixed.
""Good job, Tom! Now we need to add the milk and the sugar,"" Sara says. She pours the milk and the sugar into the bowl. ""Can you stir some more, Tom?""
""OK, Sara, I can stir some more,"" Tom says. He stirs and stirs until the milk and the sugar are mixed with the flour and the eggs. He stirs and stirs until the batter is smooth.
""Wow, Tom, you are a good stirrer!"" Sara says. ""Now we need to put the batter in the pan and bake the cake.""
""OK, Sara, let's do that,"" Tom says. They pour the batter in the pan and put the pan in the oven. They set the timer and wait for the cake to be done.
While they wait, they see a letter on the table. It is from Grandma. Sara picks up the letter and opens it. She reads it out loud to Tom.
""Dear Sara and Tom, I miss you very much. I hope you are having fun and being good. I sent you a nice surprise in the mail. It should arrive soon. I love you. Grandma.""
""Wow, Sara, Grandma is so nice!"" Tom says. ""I wonder what the surprise is.""
""Me too, Tom. Maybe it is a toy or a book or a candy,"" Sara says. ""I love Grandma.""
""I love Grandma too,"" Tom says. They hug each other and smile.
Then they hear the timer beep. The cake is done. They take it out of the oven and let it cool. They decorate it with frosting and sprinkles. They write ""We love you, Mom"" on the cake with a squeeze bottle.
They are very proud of their cake. They can't wait to show it to Mom and share it with her. They know Mom will love it. They know Mom is nice. They love Mom."
"Once upon a time, there was a parrot named Polly. Polly was very colorful and had a big beak. Polly lived in a deep forest with many other animals. One day, Polly decided to travel to a new place. 
Polly flew for a long time until she reached a big city. She saw many people and buildings, but she didn't know where to go. Suddenly, a man came and took Polly away. He put Polly in a small cage and took her to his house. 
Polly was very sad because she missed her friends in the deep forest. She tried to escape from the cage, but she couldn't. She realized that it was not a good idea to travel alone without knowing where to go. 
The moral of the story is that it's important to be careful when we travel and to always have a plan. We should also be kind to animals and not take them away from their homes."
"Once upon a time, there was a girl named Lily who loved to play dress-up. She would fashion her own outfits from her mom's old clothes and pretend she was a princess. One day, Lily's mom bought her a special present - a dollhouse! Lily was so happy and couldn't wait to play with it. 
But the dollhouse was in a big box and Lily's mom said they had to wrap it first before she could open it. So they got some paper and tape and wrapped the box up nice and tight. Lily was so excited to see her new toy that she couldn't wait for her mom to finish wrapping. 
Finally, the box was all wrapped up and Lily tore off the paper to reveal her new dollhouse. It was so pretty and regular sized, just perfect for her dolls to live in. Lily spent the whole day playing with her new toy, imagining all sorts of adventures for her dolls to go on."

""Sure, but be careful. Don't go near the fire pit. It is very hot and dangerous,"" dad said.
Sara and Ben nodded and ran to the leaves. They jumped and laughed and threw leaves in the air. They felt happy and warm.
But then Ben saw something shiny in the fire pit. It looked like a spark. He was curious and wanted to see it better. He walked closer to the fire pit.
""Ben, no! Come back!"" Sara shouted. She saw the fire pit and remembered what dad said. She was scared for Ben.
Ben did not listen. He reached out his hand to touch the spark. But the spark was not alone. There was a thick smoke and a loud crackle. Ben felt a pain in his hand and a heat in his face. He screamed and pulled back his hand.
Dad heard the scream and ran to the fire pit. He saw Ben crying and holding his hand. He saw the smoke and the spark. He was angry and worried.
""Ben, what did you do? I told you not to go near the fire pit. You could have been hurt very badly. Let me see your hand,"" dad said.
He took Ben's hand and looked at it. It was red and swollen. He wrapped it in a cloth and hugged Ben.
""I'm sorry, dad. I wanted to see the spark. It seemed pretty. I didn't know it was hot and bad,"" Ben said.
""I know, Ben. But you have to listen to me. The fire pit is not a toy. It is for grown-ups only. The spark can burn you and make you sick. You have to be careful and stay away from it. Do you understand?"" dad said.
""Yes, dad. I understand. I'm sorry. I won't do it again,"" Ben said.
Dad kissed Ben's head and carried him inside. He gave him some ice and some medicine. He told him to rest and be brave.

""Ow, ow, ow!"" Anna cried. ""I cut my thumb! It hurts!""
Tom heard her cry and ran to her. He saw her thumb and the blood. He felt sorry for her, but he also felt disgusted. He did not like blood. It made him feel sick.
""Anna, don't cry. Let me see your thumb,"" Tom said. He took her hand and looked at the cut. It was not very big, but it was deep. He knew he had to help her. He remembered what his mom told him to do when he got a cut.
""Anna, we have to wash your thumb and put a band-aid on it. Come with me to the bathroom,"" Tom said. He led her to the sink and turned on the water. He washed her thumb gently and dried it with a towel. He found a band-aid in the cabinet and put it on her thumb.
""There, all done. Does it feel better?"" Tom asked.
Anna nodded. She felt less pain and more calm. She smiled at Tom and thanked him.
""Thank you, Tom. You are very kind. You are a good friend,"" Anna said.
Tom smiled back. He was glad he could help her. He was a good friend.
""Anna, you are welcome. You are a good friend too. Do you want to play something else?"" Tom asked.
Anna nodded. She did not want to play with scissors and paper anymore. She wanted to play something safer and funnier.
""Tom, can we play with the blocks and make a castle?"" Anna asked.
Tom nodded. He liked blocks and castles. He agreed with Anna.
""Anna, yes, let's play with the blocks and make a castle. That sounds like fun,"" Tom said.

""Let's open it and see what's inside!"" Ben said.
""Okay, but be careful. It might be locked or have something scary in it."" Lily said.
They tried to pull the buckle, but it was too hard. They pushed and twisted it, but it did not move.
""I don't understand. How do we open it?"" Ben asked.
""Maybe we need a key or a code or something."" Lily said.
They looked around the attic for clues, but they did not find anything. They were about to give up, when they heard a voice.
""Hello, children. Do you want to play a game?"" The voice came from the suitcase.
Ben and Lily were surprised and curious. They went closer to the suitcase and saw a small speaker on it.
""Who are you? Where are you?"" Ben asked.
""I am the suitcase. I have been waiting for someone to open me for a long time. I have many secrets and treasures inside, but you have to solve a riddle to unlock me."" The voice said.
""A riddle? What is a riddle?"" Lily asked.
""A riddle is a question that has a clever or funny answer. If you guess the answer, you can open the buckle. If you don't, you can try again later. Do you want to try?"" The voice said.
Ben and Lily nodded. They liked games and puzzles. They wanted to see what was inside the suitcase.
""Okay, here is the riddle. Listen carefully. What has a face and two hands, but no arms or legs?"" The voice said.
Ben and Lily thought hard. They looked at each other and whispered.
""Is it a clock?"" Ben said.
""Or a watch?"" Lily said.
They decided to say both answers, just in case.
""A clock or a watch!"" They shouted together.
The voice laughed.
""Very good, children. You are smart and adventurous. You guessed the riddle. You can open the buckle now. Go ahead and see what I have for you."" The voice said.
Ben and Lily were excited. They pulled the buckle again, and this time it opened. They lifted the lid of the suitcase and saw a lot of colorful things inside. There were books and toys and clothes and pictures and more.
""Wow, look at all this stuff!"" Ben said.
""It's amazing! It's like a treasure chest!"" Lily said.
They started to take out the things and play with them. They found a storybook about pirates and a teddy bear with a patch and a dress with sparkles and a camera with a flash and more.
They thanked the voice and the suitcase for the game and the gifts. They had a lot of fun and learned new things. They decided to keep the suitcase as their secret friend and visit it often. They were happy and adventurous twins."

"Tommy loved to draw with his pencil. He drew cars and planes and houses and animals. He drew on paper and on the wall and on the floor. Sometimes his mom got mad at him for making a mess, but Tommy did not care. He wanted to be an artist.
One day, Tommy found a big, blank canvas in the garage. It was white and smooth and perfect for his pencil. He dragged it to his room and put it on his bed. He climbed on the bed and started to draw. He drew a big sun and a blue sky and a green field. He drew a brown cow and a yellow duck and a pink pig. He was very happy.
""Tommy, what are you doing?"" his mom asked, opening the door. She saw the canvas and the pencil and the drawings. She was very angry. ""Tommy, this is not your canvas! This is your dad's canvas! He is a painter and he needs this canvas for his work! You ruined it with your filthy pencil!""
Tommy was scared. He did not know the canvas was his dad's. He did not know his dad was a painter. He thought his dad was a doctor. He wanted to say sorry, but he could not find the words.
His mom grabbed the canvas and the pencil and threw them in the trash. She told Tommy to go to the corner and think about what he did. Tommy went to the corner and cried. He felt very bad.
Later, his dad came home. He saw the trash and the canvas and the pencil and the drawings. He was very curious. He took them out and looked at them. He saw the sun and the sky and the field. He saw the cow and the duck and the pig. He smiled. He saw something else. He saw a small, faint signature at the bottom of the canvas. It said ""Tommy"".
He went to Tommy's room and found him in the corner. He knelt down and hugged him. He told him he was not mad. He told him he liked his drawings. He told him he was proud of him. He told him he was an artist.
Tommy was surprised. He looked at his dad and saw his smile. He smiled back. He felt very happy.

One day, they see a big pile of twigs near a tree. They run to it and start to take some. They do not see the sign that says ""Do not touch"". They do not hear Mom calling them to come back.
The pile of twigs is not just twigs. It is a nest for bees. The bees do not like Lily and Ben taking their twigs. They get angry and fly out of the nest. They buzz very loud and sting Lily and Ben all over.
Lily and Ben scream and cry. They drop the twigs and run to Mom. Mom hugs them and takes them to the car. She drives them to the doctor. The doctor gives them medicine and bandages. He says they will be okay, but they have to stay home for a few days.
Lily and Ben are very sad. They do not like bees. They do not like twigs. They do not want to visit the park again. They wish they had listened to Mom."
"Sam and Lily were playing soccer in the park. They liked to kick the ball and run after it. Sometimes they would pass the ball to each other and try to score a goal.
""Pass me the ball, Lily!"" Sam shouted. He was near the goal and wanted to try a shot.
Lily kicked the ball hard to Sam. But the ball was too fast and went over his head. It landed near a big tree, where a boy was sitting and reading a book.
""Hey, that's our ball!"" Sam said. He ran to the tree and tried to get the ball back. But the boy did not let him. He held the ball in his arms and said, ""No, this is my ball now. I found it.""
""That's not fair!"" Lily said. She ran to the tree too and tried to help Sam. ""You did not find it, you took it. Give it back to us!""
The boy shook his head and said, ""No, this is a brilliant ball. It is shiny and round and bouncy. I like it. It is mine.""
Sam and Lily did not know what to do. They wanted their ball back, but the boy was bigger and stronger than them. They looked at each other and had an idea.
They both kneeled on the ground and pretended to cry. They made loud and sad noises. They said, ""Please, please, give us our ball back. We love our ball. It is our favorite toy. We have nothing else to play with. Please, please, don't be mean.""
The boy heard them and felt sorry for them. He did not like to see them cry. He said, ""OK, OK, stop crying. Here, take your ball back. But you have to let me play with you. I have no friends to play with. Please, please, don't be mean.""
Sam and Lily stopped crying and smiled. They said, ""OK, OK, you can play with us. But you have to be nice and share the ball. We can all have fun together. Please, please, don't be mean.""
The boy nodded and smiled too. He gave them the ball back and joined them. They all kicked the ball and ran after it. Sometimes they would pass the ball to each other and try to score a goal. They had a brilliant time."
"Lily and Max were playing in their room. They had many toys, but they liked to look at the photo book best. The photo book had pictures of their family and friends. They liked to point at the faces and say their names.
""Look, this is Grandma and Grandpa,"" Lily said, showing Max a photo. ""They are very nice and give us hugs and cookies.""
Max nodded and smiled. He liked Grandma and Grandpa too. He turned the page and saw a photo of a big dog. He pointed at it and said, ""Woof, woof!""
Lily giggled. She knew the dog's name was Spot. He was their uncle's dog. He was very friendly and liked to play fetch. She said, ""Spot, Spot, good dog!""
They turned more pages and saw more photos. They saw their mom and dad, their cousins, their friends, and their teacher. They said hello to each one and made noises or gestures to match them.
They were having fun, but they did not know that their mom was sleeping in the next room. She had a headache and needed to rest. She heard their voices and felt frustrated. She wanted them to be quiet and let her sleep.
She got up and went to their room. She opened the door and saw them with the photo book. She said in a loud voice, ""Lily and Max, what are you doing? You are making too much noise! You need to be quiet and let me sleep!""
Lily and Max were scared. They did not mean to make their mom angry. They loved their mom and did not want to hurt her. They said, ""Sorry, mom, sorry!""
Their mom saw their faces and felt sorry too. She knew they were just playing and did not know she was sleeping. She said, ""It's okay, my loves, I know you did not mean it. But you need to whisper when I am sleeping, okay? Whisper means to talk very softly, like this."" She leaned down and whispered in their ears, ""I love you very much.""
Lily and Max nodded and whispered back, ""I love you too, mom."" They hugged their mom and gave her a kiss. Then they went back to the photo book and whispered to each other. They were happy and quiet. Their mom smiled and went back to her room. She closed the door and fell asleep."
"Anna and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to run, jump and slide. They had a lot of fun. But after a while, they felt tired and thirsty.
""Let's rest for a bit,"" Anna said. ""I have some juice and crackers in my bag.""
""OK,"" Ben said. ""I'm hungry too.""
They sat down on a bench and opened Anna's bag. Anna gave Ben a juice box and a cracker. She took one for herself too.
They sipped their juice and nibbled their crackers. They felt better.
But then, Ben made a funny face. He spit out his cracker and said, ""Yuck! This is spicy!""
Anna looked at her cracker. It had red dots on it. She remembered that her mom had packed some spicy crackers for her dad. She had taken the wrong bag by mistake.
""I'm sorry, Ben,"" Anna said. ""These are not for us. These are for my dad. He likes spicy things.""
Ben drank some more juice and said, ""It's OK, Anna. I don't like spicy things. But I like you. You are my friend.""
Anna smiled and said, ""You are my friend too, Ben. Next time, I will bring some sweet things for us.""
They hugged and finished their juice. Then they got up and played some more. They had a lot of fun."
"Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play together in the park. One day, they found a big orange box under a tree. It had a sticker that said ""mail"".
""What is this?"" Lily asked.
""Maybe it is a treasure!"" Ben said. ""Let's open it and see!""
They opened the box and saw many shiny things inside. There were necklaces, rings, bracelets, and earrings. They sparkled in the sun.
""Wow, this is a treasure!"" Lily said. ""We are so lucky!""
""Let's try them on!"" Ben said. ""We can pretend we are kings and queens!""
They put on the jewelry and laughed. They felt very happy and fancy. They did not see a man watching them from behind a bush. He had a mean face and a big bag. He was the one who had mailed the box. He wanted to trick someone into taking it, so he could steal it back. He was a bad man.
He waited until Lily and Ben were busy playing. Then he ran out of the bush and grabbed the box. He threw the jewelry into his bag and ran away.
""Hey, stop!"" Lily and Ben shouted. ""That is our treasure!""
But the man was too fast. He disappeared into the street.
Lily and Ben were very sad. They had lost their treasure. They cried and hugged each other.
""Don't worry,"" Lily said. ""We still have each other. We are still best friends.""
""Yes,"" Ben said. ""And we still have our imagination. We can pretend we have any treasure we want.""
They smiled and wiped their tears. They decided to play something else. They did not need the orange box. They had something more precious. They had friendship."
"Lily was very happy. Today was her birthday. She had a party with her friends. They played games, ate cake and opened presents. Lily got a big doll from her mom and dad. She loved her doll very much.
But then, something bad happened. Lily saw Sam, her best friend, playing with her doll. She got angry. She ran to Sam and shouted, ""That's mine! Give it back!"" She grabbed the doll and pulled hard. Sam pulled back. They both fell down. The doll broke. Its head came off.
Lily and Sam started to cry. Their moms and dads came to see what was wrong. They saw the broken doll and the sad children. They felt sorry for them. They tried to fix the doll, but it was too late. The doll was gone.
Lily's mom hugged her and said, ""I'm sorry, honey. I know you loved your doll. But you shouldn't have fought with Sam. He is your friend. He wanted to play with your doll, not hurt it. You need to say sorry to him.""
Lily looked at Sam. He was still crying. He looked at her with his big eyes. He said, ""I'm sorry, Lily. I didn't mean to break your doll. I liked your doll. I wanted to share it with you. Can we still be friends?""
Lily felt a warm feeling in her heart. She remembered that Sam was her best friend. He always made her laugh. He always shared his toys with her. He was nice to her. She said, ""I'm sorry, too, Sam. I was mean to you. I should have let you play with my doll. You are my friend. I still like you.""
Lily and Sam hugged each other. They stopped crying. They smiled. Their moms and dads smiled, too. They were happy that Lily and Sam made up. They said, ""That's good, kids. You are good friends. Friends say sorry when they make mistakes. Friends forgive each other. Friends have fun together.""
Lily and Sam nodded. They agreed. They went back to the party. They played with the other toys. They ate more cake. They had fun. They forgot about the broken doll. They remembered their friendship."
"Lila and Ben were bored. They had no toys to play with. All their toys were in a big box. But the box had a lock. And they did not have the key.
""Where is the key?"" Lila asked.
""I don't know,"" Ben said. ""Maybe Mom has it.""
They looked for Mom. But Mom was busy. She was making dough. She was going to bake a cake.
""Mom, can we have the key?"" Lila asked.
""Not now, sweetie,"" Mom said. ""I'm busy. Go play with something else.""
But there was nothing else to play with. Lila and Ben were sad. They went back to the box. They tried to open it. But it was too hard.
""Maybe we can use something to unlock it,"" Ben said.
""Like what?"" Lila asked.
Ben looked around. He saw a dull knife. It was on the table. Mom had used it to cut the dough.
""Maybe this will work,"" Ben said. He took the knife. He went to the box. He tried to put the knife in the lock. But it did not fit.
""Be careful, Ben,"" Lila said. ""You might hurt yourself.""
Ben did not listen. He pushed harder. He twisted the knife. He heard a click. He smiled.
""I did it!"" he said. ""I unlocked the box!""
He opened the box. He saw all their toys. He was happy. He took out his favorite car. He gave Lila her favorite doll.
""Look, Lila,"" he said. ""We can play now!""
Lila was happy too. She hugged her doll. She thanked Ben.
""You're smart, Ben,"" she said. ""You unlocked the box!""
They played with their toys. They had fun. They forgot about Mom and the dough. They did not hear Mom calling them.
""Kids, come here!"" Mom said. ""The cake is ready!""
But Lila and Ben did not hear. They were too busy playing. They were not bored anymore. They were happy."
"Lila and Ben were playing in the yard. They liked to dig in the dirt and look for bugs. Sometimes they found worms, or ants, or beetles. They put them in a jar and watched them.
One day, they found something different. It was gray and hard and had many legs. It did not move or make any sound. Lila and Ben thought it was dead. They put it in the jar with the other bugs.
That night, Lila and Ben left the jar on the window sill. They went to bed and dreamed of bugs. But the gray thing was not dead. It was sleeping. And when the moon came out, it woke up. It was a firefly. It had a light in its belly that could glow.
The firefly saw the other bugs in the jar. They were scared and sad. They wanted to go out and be free. The firefly felt sorry for them. It used its light to make a hole in the lid of the jar. Then it flew out and helped the other bugs escape.
Lila and Ben woke up in the morning. They looked at the jar. It was empty. They saw a hole in the lid. They wondered what happened. They looked out the window. They saw the firefly and the other bugs flying away. They saw the firefly's light glow in the sun. They smiled and waved goodbye. They learned that some bugs are not dead, but magic."
"Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play outside and look at the sky. They see many white clouds in the blue sky. They try to guess what the clouds look like.
""Look, Anna, that cloud looks like a bunny!"" Ben says, pointing at a fluffy cloud.
""I see it, Ben, it has long ears and a tail. And that cloud looks like a flower!"" Anna says, pointing at another cloud.
They giggle and clap their hands. They see more clouds that look like animals, fruits, and toys. They have fun making up stories about the clouds.
But then, the wind blows hard and the clouds start to move. Some of the clouds get smaller and some get bigger. Some of the clouds join together and some separate.
""Oh no, the bunny cloud is gone!"" Ben says, looking sad.
""And the flower cloud too!"" Anna says, frowning.
They watch as the clouds change shape and color. They do not look like anything they know anymore.
""Maybe the clouds are playing too,"" Anna says, trying to cheer up Ben.
""Maybe they are,"" Ben says, nodding.
They decide to keep watching the clouds and see what they do next. They hope the clouds will make new shapes that they can guess. They hold hands and smile. They still like the clouds, even if they are different."
"Lily and Max were playing hide and seek in the big house. Lily was the seeker and Max was the hider. Lily counted to ten and then looked for Max. She checked the kitchen, the living room, and the bathroom, but she could not find him.
""Where are you, Max?"" she called out. ""I give up!""
She heard a giggle from behind a door. She ran to the door and opened it. It was the basement. She saw Max hiding behind a box. He had a playful smile on his face.
""Gotcha!"" she said and ran towards him.
But then she saw something else in the basement. It was a big, black spider. It had eight legs and many eyes. It was crawling on the wall. Lily was very scared of spiders. She screamed and ran back to the door.
""Help! Help! Spider!"" she cried.
Max heard her scream and saw the spider. He was not scared of spiders. He thought they were cool. He picked up a broom and tried to shoo the spider away.
""Don't worry, Lily, I'll save you!"" he said.
But the spider was fast and angry. It jumped from the wall and landed on the broom. Max dropped the broom and backed away. He and Lily both trembled with fear. They wanted to get out of the basement.
""Where is the exit?"" Lily asked.
Max looked around and saw a small window. It was high up, but he had an idea. He pushed the box he was hiding behind to the wall. He climbed on the box and reached for the window. He opened it and saw the garden outside.
""Come on, Lily, we can escape through here!"" he said.
He helped Lily climb on the box and then through the window. They jumped down and ran to the house. They hugged each other and breathed a sigh of relief.
""That was scary!"" Lily said.
""Yeah, but we made it!"" Max said.
They decided to play something else. They did not want to go back to the basement. They hoped the spider would not follow them. They were glad they had each other. They were brave and playful friends."
"Sam and Ben are brothers. They like to play with their toys. Sam has a big truck and Ben has a small car. They make noises and pretend to drive on the road.
One day, Sam sees Ben's car and wants to play with it. He says, ""Give me your car, Ben. It is nice and shiny. My truck is old and dirty.""
Ben says, ""No, Sam. This is my car. You have your truck. Go away.""
Sam does not listen. He tries to pull the car from Ben's hand. Ben holds on tight. They pull and pull and pull. The car breaks in half. They both cry.
Mom hears the noise and comes to see what is wrong. She sees the broken car and the sad boys. She says, ""What happened here? Why did you break Ben's car, Sam?""
Sam says, ""I wanted to play with it. It has a good style. My truck is dead.""
Mom says, ""That is not nice, Sam. You cannot take things that are not yours. You have to ask first. And you cannot break things that are not yours. You have to be careful. Now you have to say sorry to Ben and help him fix his car.""
Sam feels bad. He says, ""Sorry, Ben. I was wrong. Can we fix your car?""
Ben says, ""Maybe. But we need glue and tape. And we need to be gentle.""
Mom says, ""I have glue and tape. Come with me. We will fix the car together. And then you can share and play nicely.""
Sam and Ben follow Mom. They fix the car with glue and tape. It is not as shiny as before, but it still works. They say thank you to Mom. They hug each other. They play with the car and the truck. They are happy."
"Tom and Lily are friends. They like to play outside. One day, they see a big kite in the sky. It is red and yellow and has a long tail.
""Wow, look at the kite!"" Tom says. ""It is so high and fast. I want to fly a kite too.""
""Me too,"" Lily says. ""Let's go and find one.""
They run to the shed. They see a small kite. It is blue and green and has a star on it. They take the kite and a string. They go to the field.
They try to fly the kite. They run and run. But the kite does not go up. It falls to the ground.
""Why does it not fly?"" Tom asks. ""The wind is strong. It should fly.""
""Maybe the string is too short,"" Lily says. ""Or maybe the kite is too heavy.""
They look at the kite. They see a problem. The kite has a hole in it. The wind goes through the hole. The kite does not hang in the air.
""Oh no, the kite is broken,"" Tom says. ""How can we fix it?""
""Maybe we can use a patch,"" Lily says. ""Or some tape. Or some glue.""
They look for something to fix the kite. They see a big leaf. It is brown and dry. They think it can cover the hole.
They take the leaf. They put it on the hole. They use some grass to tie it. They hope it will work.
They try to fly the kite again. They run and run. The kite goes up. It hangs in the air. It moves with the wind. It looks like a bird.
""Yay, we did it!"" Tom says. ""The kite is flying. It is so pretty.""
""Yay, we are so smart!"" Lily says. ""The leaf is a good patch. It is like a wing.""
They laugh and clap. They watch the kite. They are happy.
But then, something bad happens. The wind gets stronger. It blows harder. It pulls the kite. The string breaks. The kite flies away.
""Uh oh, the kite is gone,"" Tom says. ""The wind took it. We can't get it back.""
""Uh oh, that is sad,"" Lily says. ""The kite was ours. We liked it.""
They are scared. They cry. They hug each other.
They see a man. He is walking in the field. He has a hat and a coat. He sees the kite. He catches it. He brings it to them.
""Hello, kids,"" he says. ""Is this your kite? I saw it flying in the sky. It is a nice kite. But it has a hole in it. And a leaf on it. Did you do that?""
""Yes, sir,"" Tom says. ""The kite was broken. We tried to fix it. But the wind was too strong. It broke the string. It flew away.""
""Yes, sir,"" Lily says. ""We were scared. We thought we lost it. We were sad. Thank you for finding it.""
""You're welcome, kids,"" he says. ""You are very clever. You used a leaf to patch the hole. That is a good idea. But you need a stronger string. And a smaller hole. Do you want me to help you?""
""Yes, please,"" Tom and Lily say. ""We want to fly the kite again. We want to have fun.""
""Okay, then,"" he says. ""Let's go to my house. I have some tools and materials. We can fix the kite together. And then we can fly it again. How does that sound?""
""Good, good,"" Tom and Lily say. ""Thank you, thank you.""
They go with the man. They fix the kite. They fly it again. They are happy. The end."
"Sara and Tom are brother and sister. They like to play in the garden. Sara is four and Tom is three. They have a big ball and a small car.
One day, they see a hole in the fence. They are curious. They want to know what is on the other side. They crawl through the hole. They see a big dog. The dog is brown and fluffy. It has a red collar.
""Hello, doggy!"" Sara says. ""Do you want to play with us?""
The dog wags its tail. It likes Sara and Tom. It runs to them and licks their faces. They giggle. They throw the ball and the dog fetches it. They push the car and the dog chases it. They have fun.
But then they hear their mom calling. ""Sara! Tom! Where are you? It's time to come in and have a bath!""
They look at each other. They are dirty. They have mud on their clothes and their faces. The dog has mud on its fur and its collar.
""Uh-oh,"" Tom says. ""We have to go, doggy. Bye-bye!""
They crawl back through the hole. They run to their mom. She sees them and gasps.
""What have you been doing?"" she asks. ""You are not clean at all! You need a bath right now!""
Sara and Tom nod. They are sorry. They hug their mom. They say goodbye to the dog. They hope they can play with it again. They go inside and have a bath. They wash the mud off. They become clean again. They are happy."
"Tom and Jen are friends. They like to look at the stars at night. They have a big book with pictures of stars and planets. They want to see a comet. A comet is a star with a long tail. The book says a comet will come soon.
One night, Tom and Jen go outside with their book and a flashlight. They look at the sky. They see many stars, but no comet. They are sad. They want to see the comet.
""Where is the comet?"" Tom asks.
""I don't know,"" Jen says. ""Maybe it is late.""
They wait and wait. They get cold and sleepy. They are not ready to go home. They want to see the comet.
Then, they see a bright light in the sky. It is the comet! It has a long tail. It is beautiful. Tom and Jen are happy. They jump and clap.
""Look, look, the comet!"" Jen says.
""Wow, wow, the comet!"" Tom says.
They look at the book. The book says the comet has a name. The name is Halley. Tom and Jen like the name.
""Hello, Halley!"" Tom says.
""Hello, Halley!"" Jen says.
They wave at the comet. The comet waves back. Tom and Jen smile. They are ready to go home. They have seen the comet. They are friends."
"Sara was a gifted girl who liked to paint. She had many colors and brushes and papers. She painted flowers and trees and animals and people. She was happy when she painted.
One day, her teacher said, ""Sara, you have a very good talent. I want to display your paintings in the school hall. Everyone can see them and admire them. Do you want to do that?""
Sara nodded and smiled. She was proud of her paintings. She wanted to share them with others. She said, ""Yes, teacher, I want to do that. Thank you for liking my paintings.""
The next day, Sara and her teacher went to the school hall. They hung Sara's paintings on the walls. They looked very beautiful and colorful. Sara saw her name on a sign. She felt happy.
Then, Sara saw her mom and dad at the gate. They came to see her paintings. They hugged her and said, ""Sara, you are a gifted girl. We are very proud of you. Your paintings are wonderful. You have a very good talent.""
Sara smiled and said, ""Thank you, mom and dad. I love you. I love painting. I want to paint more and more."""
"Tommy loved ice cream. He liked to feel the cold and sweet in his mouth. He liked to lick the cone and make it last. He liked to choose different flavors every time.
One day, he went to the park with his mom. He saw a big ice cream truck. He ran to it and asked for a cone. The man gave him a cone with three scoops: chocolate, vanilla and strawberry. Tommy was very happy. He thanked the man and paid with his mom's money.
He walked back to his mom, holding his cone carefully. He saw a little girl on a bench. She had no ice cream. She looked sad. Tommy felt sorry for her. He wanted to share his ice cream with her. He walked to her and said, ""Hi, I'm Tommy. Do you want some of my ice cream? It's delicious.""
The little girl smiled. She said, ""Hi, I'm Lily. Thank you, that's very nice of you. I would love some of your ice cream."" She took a lick of the strawberry scoop. She said, ""Mmm, this is my favorite flavor. You are very kind, Tommy.""
Tommy and Lily became friends. They shared the cone and talked. They had fun. Tommy's mom saw them and smiled. She was proud of Tommy. She knew he had a big heart. She thought, ""Sharing is caring. Tommy learned a good lesson today."""
"Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play with toys. One day, they find a big box in the park. The box has a picture of a yacht on it.
""Wow, look at this!"" Anna says. ""It is a yacht. A big boat that can go on the water.""
""Can we open it?"" Ben asks. ""Maybe we can play with it.""
Anna nods. She and Ben open the box. Inside, they see a yacht. But it is not a regular yacht. It is a toy yacht. It is made of plastic and has wheels.
""Wow, this is cool!"" Ben says. ""But how can we play with it? It cannot go on the water.""
Anna thinks. She has an idea. She points to the slide in the park.
""Let's take it to the slide!"" she says. ""We can pretend that the slide is the water. We can make the yacht go down the slide and say 'whee!'""
Ben likes the idea. He and Anna take the yacht to the slide. They put it on the top and push it down. The yacht slides down fast and makes a noise.
""Whee!"" Anna and Ben say. ""This is fun!""
They play with the yacht on the slide for a long time. They are happy. They have a new toy and a new game."
"Lily was a nosy girl. She liked to look at other people's things. One day, she saw a diary on her big sister's bed. She wanted to read it. She took the diary and opened it.
""Hey, that's mine!"" her big sister, Anna, shouted. She ran into the room and grabbed the diary from Lily. ""You can't read my diary, it's private!""
""But I want to know what you write,"" Lily said. ""Why do you hide it?""
""Because it's none of your business,"" Anna said. ""You are too little to understand. Now go away and play with your toys.""
Lily was sad and angry. She did not like her big sister. She wanted to make her sorry. She saw a chew toy on the floor. It belonged to their dog, Spot. She had an idea. She took the chew toy and ran to the kitchen. She found some peanut butter and spread it on the chew toy. Then she went back to her sister's room and put the chew toy on the diary.
Soon, Spot smelled the peanut butter. He followed his nose to the diary. He saw the chew toy and licked it. He liked it. He started to chew it. He also chewed the diary. He tore the pages and made a mess.
Anna heard the noise and came back to her room. She saw Spot and the diary. She screamed. ""No, Spot, stop! Bad dog! You ruined my diary!""
Lily heard the scream and smiled. She thought it was funny. She said, ""Now you know how I feel. Maybe next time you will share with me."""
"Tom and Anna were playing hide and seek in the garden. Tom was the seeker and Anna was the hider. Anna ran behind a big bush and crouched down. She felt comfortable and safe. She hoped Tom would not find her.
Tom looked around the garden. He saw a ball, a swing, a slide, and a tree. He did not see Anna. He wondered where she was. He decided to check behind the bush. He walked slowly and quietly. He saw a cup on the ground. He picked it up and smiled. He had an idea.
He shouted, ""Anna, Anna, where are you? I have a surprise for you!"" He held the cup behind his back. He hoped Anna would come out.
Anna heard Tom's voice. She was curious. She wanted to see the surprise. She peeked out from behind the bush. She saw Tom standing with a cup. She asked, ""What is it, Tom? What do you have?""
Tom said, ""Come here, Anna. I will show you."" He waited for Anna to come closer. He said, ""Are you ready?"" He moved the cup in front of him. He revealed a frog. He said, ""Look, Anna. A frog!""
Anna screamed. She did not like frogs. She was scared. She ran away from Tom. She said, ""No, Tom, no! I don't want a frog! That's not a surprise, that's a trick!""
Tom laughed. He said, ""I found you, Anna. I win!"" He put the frog back on the ground. He said, ""Don't be mad, Anna. It was just a joke. Come on, let's play again.""
Anna stopped running. She looked at Tom. She was still a little angry, but she also wanted to play. She said, ""OK, Tom. But this time, I will be the seeker and you will be the hider. And no more frogs, OK?""
Tom nodded. He said, ""OK, Anna. No more frogs. You can be the seeker and I will be the hider. But you have to count to ten first.""
Anna agreed. She said, ""OK, Tom. I will count to ten. One, two, three..."" She closed her eyes and started counting. Tom ran away to find a good hiding spot. He hoped Anna would not find him. He also hoped he would not find another frog. He thought, ""Hide and seek is fun."""
"Lily and Anna were best friends. They liked to play with dolls and dress up. One day, they found a pretty box under Lily's bed. It had a lock and a key.
""What is in the box?"" Anna asked.
""I don't know. It is a secret,"" Lily said. She took the key and opened the box. Inside, there were many shiny things. There were rings, necklaces, bracelets, and earrings.
""Wow, they are so pretty!"" Anna said. She reached for a ring.
""Stop! Don't touch them!"" Lily said. She pulled the box away from Anna. ""They are mine! They are from my grandma. She gave them to me before she went away. She said they are very special and I have to keep them safe.""
""But I just want to look at them. Please, can I try one on?"" Anna said. She felt sad and angry. She thought Lily was being mean and selfish.
""No, you can't! They are not for you. They are only for me. Go away!"" Lily said. She closed the box and put it back under the bed. She turned her back to Anna.
Anna felt tears in her eyes. She did not want to play with Lily anymore. She got up and ran out of the room. She did not say goodbye.
Lily heard Anna leave. She felt lonely and sorry. She did not mean to hurt Anna. She loved her friend. She wanted to share her pretty things with her. But she was afraid to lose them. She remembered how her grandma hugged her and told her to take good care of them. She missed her grandma very much.
She got the box out again and opened it. She looked at the shiny things. They were pretty, but they did not make her happy. She wished Anna was there with her. She wanted to say sorry and give her a hug. She wanted to tell her the secret of the box. She wanted to play with her again.
She took the key and ran after Anna. She hoped she would find her and make up with her. She hoped Anna would still be her friend. She hoped they could seat together and look at the pretty things and smile."
"Lila was a big girl who liked to drive her toy car. She had a pink car with four wheels and a horn. She liked to go fast and make noise. She also had a license that her dad made for her. It had her name and picture on it. She was very proud of her license.
One day, Lila wanted to drive her car to the park. She asked her mom if she could go. Her mom said yes, but she had to be careful and follow the rules. Lila said okay and put on her helmet. She took her license and her car and went outside.
On the way to the park, Lila saw a big, shiny car. It was a modern car with many buttons and lights. It looked very cool and fun. Lila wanted to see it closer. She drove her car next to the modern car and stopped. She looked at the driver. He was a man with a beard and glasses. He smiled at Lila and said hello.
""Hi,"" Lila said. ""I like your car. It is very modern.""
""Thank you,"" the man said. ""I like your car too. It is very cute.""
""Can I see your car?"" Lila asked. ""Can I touch the buttons?""
""Sure,"" the man said. ""But you have to be careful. Some buttons are not for kids.""
Lila nodded and got out of her car. She walked to the modern car and climbed inside. She saw many buttons and lights. She touched some of them. They made sounds and changed colors. She liked them a lot. She felt like a real driver.
The man watched Lila and laughed. He said she was a smart and curious girl. He asked her if she had a license. Lila said yes and showed him her license. He said it was very nice and asked her if she made it herself. Lila said no, her dad made it for her. He said her dad was very clever and kind.
Lila and the man talked for a while. They became friends. They shared stories and jokes. They had fun. Lila forgot about the park. She was happy in the modern car.
After some time, Lila felt tired. She yawned and rubbed her eyes. She said she wanted to sleep. The man said he was tired too. He said they should go back to their cars and sleep. Lila agreed. She said goodbye to the man and thanked him for letting her see his car. He said goodbye to Lila and thanked her for being his friend. He gave her a hug and a kiss.
Lila got out of the modern car and walked to her car. She got in and put on her helmet. She drove her car back to her house. She parked her car in the garage and took her license. She went inside and found her mom. She told her mom about her adventure and showed her her license. Her mom said she was very brave and adventurous. She said she was proud of her. She gave her a hug and a kiss.
Lila said she was hungry and sleepy. Her mom said she would make her some food and then tuck her in bed. Lila said okay and smiled. She ate her food and drank her milk. She brushed her teeth and put on her pajamas. She went to her room and climbed into her bed. She put her license under her pillow and hugged her teddy bear. She closed her eyes and fell asleep. She dreamed of driving the modern car with her new friend. She was happy."
"Anna and Ben like to play in the kitchen. They pretend to cook and wash dishes. One day, they find a big green apple on the table. Anna wants to eat it, but Ben has an idea.
""Let's put the apple in the sink and see what happens,"" he says.
""Why?"" Anna asks.
""Maybe it will float or sink or make bubbles,"" Ben says.
They fill the sink with water and drop the apple in. The apple sinks to the bottom. Anna and Ben are surprised.
""Look, the apple is under the water,"" Anna says.
""Maybe it is too heavy to float,"" Ben says.
They try to reach the apple with their hands, but the water is too deep. They look for a spoon or a fork, but they cannot find any.
""Mom, can you help us?"" Anna calls.
Mom comes to the kitchen and sees the apple in the sink. She smiles and shakes her head.
""What are you doing, kids?"" she asks.
""We wanted to see what the apple would do in the water,"" Ben says.
""Well, it looks like it remains in the sink,"" Mom says.
She drains the water and takes out the apple. She wipes it with a towel and cuts it into pieces.
""Here, you can share the apple now,"" she says.
Anna and Ben are happy. They thank Mom and eat the apple. They think it is very sweet and juicy. They decide to play with something else next time."
"Tom and Lily were friends who liked to play in the garden. They liked to smell the herbs that grew there, like mint and rosemary. They liked to see the sun shine on the flowers and the bees. They liked to hear the birds sing and the wind blow.
One day, Tom and Lily saw a new herb in the garden. It was tall and green, with purple flowers. It smelled sweet and spicy. They wanted to touch it and taste it, but they did not know what it was.
""Let's ask Mom,"" Tom said.
""No, let's try it ourselves,"" Lily said. ""It looks yummy.""
Lily picked a leaf and put it in her mouth. She made a face and spat it out. ""Yuck! It's bitter and hot!""
Tom laughed. ""You're silly, Lily. You should not eat things you don't know.""
Lily felt angry and sad. She wanted to make Tom feel bad too. She saw a shiny red berry on the herb. She picked it and gave it to Tom. ""Here, try this. It's sweet and juicy.""
Tom trusted Lily. He took the berry and bit it. He felt a pain in his mouth and his throat. He dropped the berry and cried. ""Ow! Ow! It hurts! It burns!""
Lily saw Tom cry and felt scared. She did not mean to hurt him. She wanted to help him, but she did not know how. She ran to the house and called Mom.
Mom came and saw Tom. She saw the herb and the berry. She knew what they were. They were poison. She was very angry and very worried. She took Tom to the car and drove to the hospital.
Lily stayed in the garden. She felt lonely and sorry. She wished she had not given Tom the berry. She wished she had listened to him. She wished they were still friends. She cried and cried. The sun did not shine for her anymore."
"Anna and Ben were friends who liked to play in the garden. One day, they saw a big bush with many blueberries on it. They ran to the bush and picked some blueberries to eat.
""These are yummy!"" Anna said.
""Yes, they are!"" Ben agreed.
But then they saw something strange. Some of the blueberries were glowing. They were bright and shiny, like stars.
""Wow, look at these!"" Ben said. He reached for a glowing blueberry.
""Wait, Ben!"" Anna said. ""Maybe they are not good to eat. Maybe they are hot or bad.""
But Ben did not listen. He put the glowing blueberry in his mouth. He felt a sharp pain. He spit out the blueberry and cried.
""Ow, ow, ow! It is hot! It burned my tongue!"" Ben said.
Anna felt sorry for Ben. She gave him some water and a hug.
""I'm sorry, Ben. I tried to warn you,"" Anna said.
""I'm sorry, Anna. I should have listened to you,"" Ben said.
They learned a lesson that day. They learned to be careful and not to eat things that look strange. They learned to listen to their friends who care for them. They learned that glowing blueberries are not yummy."
"Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play in the park. They like to swing, slide and run. They have fun with their friends.
One day, they go to the park with their mom. The sun is bright and warm. They see some flowers. They are yellow and pink and purple. They smell good. Sara and Ben want to pick some flowers for their mom.
They run to the flowers. They see a big bee. It is black and yellow. It buzzes loud. It looks angry. Sara and Ben are scared. They do not like bees. They think bees can hurt them.
The bee flies to Sara. Sara screams. She springs away from the bee. She runs to her mom. The bee follows her. Ben sees the bee. He wants to help Sara. He picks up a stick. He swings the stick at the bee. He misses. The bee flies to Ben. Ben screams. He springs away from the bee. He runs to his mom. The bee follows him.
Sara and Ben reach their mom. They hug her. They cry. They tell her about the bee. Their mom is kind. She hugs them. She tells them not to be afraid. She tells them the bee is gone. She tells them the bee was not mean. She tells them the bee was just doing its job. She tells them the bee makes honey. She tells them honey is sweet and good.
Sara and Ben stop crying. They look at the flowers. They are still pretty. They ask their mom if they can pick some flowers. Their mom says yes. She says they can pick some flowers, but they have to be careful. She says they have to watch out for bees. She says they have to respect the bees. She says the bees are not their enemies. She says the bees are their friends.
Sara and Ben nod. They understand. They say sorry to the bee. They say thank you to the bee. They pick some flowers. They give them to their mom. Their mom smiles. She says they are beautiful. She says she loves them. She says they are brave. She says they are smart.
Sara and Ben smile. They feel happy. They feel proud. They go back to play. They have fun. They do not see the bee again. They do not mind. They know the bee is busy. They know the bee is happy. They know the bee is their friend."
"Tom and Sam are brothers. They like to play with cars and trucks. They have a big toy truck that can make noises and move. They need fuel to make the truck go. Fuel is a liquid that comes from a can.
One day, they find a can of fuel in the garage. They think it is for their truck. They pour some fuel into the truck and turn it on. The truck makes a loud noise and smoke. Tom and Sam are happy. They drive the truck around the garage.
""Look, our truck is so fast and strong!"" Tom says.
""Yes, it is the best truck ever!"" Sam says.
They do not see their dad coming into the garage. He smells the fuel and sees the smoke. He is angry and scared. He runs to the truck and turns it off. He grabs Tom and Sam and takes them outside.
""What are you doing? This is not fuel for your truck! This is fuel for the lawn mower! It is dangerous! It can make fire and hurt you!"" he yells.
Tom and Sam are sad and sorry. They did not know. They cry and hug their dad.
""I'm sorry, dad. We did not know. We just wanted to play with our truck."" Tom says.
""Me too, dad. We did not mean to be bad."" Sam says.
Their dad hugs them back. He is glad they are not hurt. He tells them to never touch the fuel again. He tells them to relax and calm down. He takes them inside to have some juice and cookies.
But when they go back to the garage, they see their truck is dead. The fuel has ruined it. It does not make noises or move anymore. It is broken and useless. Tom and Sam are very sad. They loved their truck. They wish they had not used the wrong fuel. They have no more fun with their truck. The end."
"Tim and Mia like to play in the park. They run and jump and laugh. They see many things in nature: trees, flowers, birds, bugs. They like to pretend they are explorers.
One day, they find a big hill. They want to climb it and see what is on the other side. They hold hands and start to walk up the hill. But the hill is very steep and slippery. They slip and slide and fall. They get dirty and tired.
""Tim, I don't want to climb anymore,"" Mia says. ""It is too hard and scary.""
""Come on, Mia, don't give up,"" Tim says. ""We are almost there. I want to see what is on the other side. Maybe there is a treasure or a castle or a dragon.""
""No, Tim, I want to go back,"" Mia says. ""I want to play on the swings or the slide or the sandbox. They are more fun and safe.""
Tim and Mia look at each other. They have different ideas. They don't know what to do. They feel sad and angry.
Then, they hear a voice. It is their mom. She is calling them from the bottom of the hill.
""Tim, Mia, where are you?"" she says. ""It is time to go home. Come down, please.""
Tim and Mia look at each other again. They smile. They have a way to end their fight. They both say the same word.
""Surrender!""
They let go of their hands and roll down the hill. They laugh and scream and enjoy the ride. They land on the grass and hug each other. They are not mad anymore. They are happy.
They run to their mom and tell her about their adventure. She listens and smiles. She hugs them and says they are brave and smart. She says she loves them.
They go home and have a snack and a nap. They dream of nature and deep hills and treasures and castles and dragons. They are friends. They are explorers."
"Lily and Ben were bored. They wanted to play outside, but it was raining. They looked at the window and saw a big puddle. They had an idea.
""Let's put on our boots and coats and go to the puddle!"" Lily said.
""OK!"" Ben agreed.
They ran to the door and opened it. They saw a goat in their yard. The goat was eating their flowers. They were surprised.
""Hey, goat, stop that!"" Lily shouted.
The goat looked at them and made a loud noise. It did not stop eating. Lily and Ben ran to the puddle. They picked up some sticks and dipped them in the water. They tried to spray the goat with the water.
""Shoo, goat, shoo!"" Ben said.
The goat did not like the water. It shook its head and ran away. Lily and Ben laughed. They had fun spraying the water. They forgot about the rain. They were happy."
"Anna and Ben are twins. They like to play outside in the garden. One day, they see a big box near the fence. They run to the box and open it. Inside, they find a telescope.
""What is this?"" Anna asks.
""It is a thing to look at the stars,"" Ben says. He remembers seeing a picture of a telescope in a book.
""Can we try it?"" Anna says.
""Yes, but we have to wait for the night,"" Ben says.
They put the telescope in a safe place and go back to play. When the sun goes down, they ask their mom if they can use the telescope.
""Okay, but be careful and don't stay up too late,"" mom says.
She helps them set up the telescope in the garden. She shows them how to point it at the sky and adjust the lens.
""Now you can gaze at the stars,"" she says.
Anna and Ben take turns to look through the telescope. They see many bright dots and some big ones that look like balls.
""Wow, they are so pretty,"" Anna says.
""What are they?"" Ben asks.
""They are stars and planets,"" mom says. ""They are very far away from the earth.""
""What is the earth?"" Ben asks.
""The earth is where we live,"" mom says. ""It is a big ball too, but we can't see it from here.""
""Can we go to the stars and planets?"" Anna asks.
""Maybe one day, when you grow up,"" mom says. ""But for now, you can enjoy their gentle light and wonder about them.""
Anna and Ben nod. They gaze at the stars and planets for a long time. They feel happy and curious. They thank mom for the telescope and give her a hug. Then they go to bed and dream of space."
"Ben and Mia were playing with their toys in the living room. They had many different objects, like cars, dolls, blocks, and books. They liked to make up stories and pretend with their objects.
""Look, I made a castle with my blocks!"" Mia said, showing Ben her creation. ""It has a princess and a dragon and a knight!""
""That's cool, Mia!"" Ben said. ""Can I play with your dragon?""
""OK, but be careful. He is very fierce and can breathe fire!"" Mia said, handing Ben the dragon.
Ben took the dragon and made it fly around the castle. He made roaring noises and pretended the dragon was attacking the knight. ""Rrrr! I am the dragon and I will burn your castle!"" he said.
""Hey, stop that!"" Mia said, getting upset. ""You are ruining my story! The dragon is nice and the knight is his friend!""
""No, the dragon is mean and the knight is his enemy!"" Ben said, not listening to Mia.
They started to argue and pull the dragon from each other. The dragon's tail snapped off and they both gasped.
""Look what you did!"" Mia said, crying. ""You broke my dragon! He was my favorite object!""
""I'm sorry, Mia!"" Ben said, feeling bad. ""I didn't mean to break him! Can we fix him?""
They looked at the dragon's tail and tried to put it back on, but it didn't work. They felt sad and angry.
Then, Ben had an idea. He ran to his room and came back with some tape and a feather. He taped the feather to the dragon's tail and showed it to Mia.
""Look, Mia! I solved the problem! I made a new tail for your dragon! It is original and pretty!"" he said, hoping Mia would like it.
Mia looked at the dragon and smiled. She liked the new tail. It was different and fun. She hugged Ben and thanked him.
""Thank you, Ben! You are a good brother! I like your new tail for my dragon! It is original and pretty!"" she said, feeling happy.
They hugged the dragon and played with him again. They made up a new story where the dragon had a magic feather tail that could do amazing things. They had fun and forgot their fight. They were friends again."
"Lily and Tom were playing with their blocks in the living room. They liked to build towers and houses and bridges with the colorful blocks. They were having fun and making noises.
But then, their big brother Sam came in. He was bored and wanted to play too. He saw the blocks and had a bad idea. He decided to destroy what Lily and Tom had built. He kicked and smashed and threw the blocks everywhere. He laughed and said, ""This is more fun!""
Lily and Tom were very sad and angry. They saw their blocks broken and scattered. They cried and shouted, ""Stop it, Sam! You are mean and naughty! You ruined our game!""
Mom heard the noise and came to see what was wrong. She saw the mess and the tears. She was not happy with Sam. She scolded him and said, ""Sam, what did you do? You should not destroy your siblings' toys. You should be kind and share. Go to your room and think about what you did.""
She hugged Lily and Tom and said, ""I'm sorry, my loves. Don't worry, we can fix the blocks and play again. You did a good job building. I'm proud of you."" She helped them pick up the blocks and put them in a box. She gave them some cookies and milk and said, ""Let's go to the couch and read a story. That will make you feel better.""
Lily and Tom nodded and smiled. They followed Mom to the couch and snuggled with her. They felt comfortable and safe. They listened to Mom's voice and looked at the pictures. They forgot about Sam and the blocks. They were happy again."
"Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play at the park. They have a ball, a pen and some paper.
""Let's draw something with the pen,"" Sara says.
""OK, what do you want to draw?"" Ben asks.
""I want to draw a flower. You can draw a car,"" Sara says.
They sit on the grass and start to draw. Sara makes a big circle and some petals. Ben makes a box and some wheels.
""Look, this is my flower. It is yellow and pretty,"" Sara says, showing her paper.
""Look, this is my car. It is red and fast,"" Ben says, showing his paper.
They are happy with their drawings. They put them on the ground and play with the ball. They throw the ball to each other and catch it.
Suddenly, a big dog runs to them. It sees the paper on the ground. It thinks it is a toy. It grabs the paper with its mouth and runs away.
""Hey, that's our paper! Give it back!"" Sara and Ben shout.
They chase the dog, but it is too fast. It runs to the other side of the park. Sara and Ben are sad. They lost their drawings.
They go back to their spot. They see the pen on the grass. It is broken. The dog bit it too hard.
""Oh no, our pen is broken too. Now we can't draw anymore,"" Sara says.
Ben picks up the pen. He tries to write with it, but it does not work. He throws it away.
""It's OK, Sara. We can get a new pen. And we can draw again. Maybe we can draw something else. Like a bird or a star,"" Ben says.
He hugs Sara. Sara smiles.
""You're right, Ben. We can draw again. And we can play with the ball. And we can have fun at the park. You're a good friend,"" Sara says.
They hug each other. They play with the ball. They have fun at the park. They are friends."
"Lily was a daughter who liked to play with her toys. She had a doll, a bear, a ball and a car. She loved them all very much and took good care of them. She always put them away when she was done playing.
One day, her mom said, ""Lily, we have to go to the store. Can you help me get ready?"" Lily nodded and ran to her room. She wanted to bring her doll with her, but she could not find it. She looked under her bed, in her closet, in her drawers, but it was not there. She felt sad and scared. Where was her doll?
She ran to her mom and said, ""Mom, I can't find my doll. I want to bring her with me. Where is she?"" Her mom frowned and said, ""I don't know, Lily. Did you put her away last time you played with her?"" Lily nodded, but she was not sure. Maybe she left her somewhere else. Maybe someone took her. She started to cry.
Her mom hugged her and said, ""Don't worry, Lily. We will find your doll. Maybe she is in the living room or the kitchen. Let's go look together."" They walked to the living room and saw Lily's brother, Tom, sitting on the couch. He was holding Lily's doll and making her talk in a funny voice. He was pretending that the doll was his friend and that they were going on a trip.
Lily saw her doll and shouted, ""Tom, that's my doll! Give her back to me! You are bad!"" She ran to him and tried to grab her doll, but Tom held it tight. He said, ""No, Lily, this is my doll now. She likes me better than you. You are bad!"" He stuck out his tongue at her.
Lily and Tom started to fight over the doll. They pulled and pushed and yelled. Their mom saw them and said, ""Stop it, both of you! You are being very naughty. Tom, give Lily her doll back. She is not yours. Lily, don't hit your brother. He is not bad. You are both good, but you need to share and be nice."" She took the doll from Tom and gave it to Lily. She said, ""Lily, I'm sorry that Tom took your doll. He was wrong to do that. But you can let him play with her sometimes, if he asks nicely. Tom, I'm sorry that Lily hit you. She was angry and scared. But you can't take her toys without asking. You have to respect her things and her feelings.""
Lily and Tom looked at each other and felt sorry. They said, ""I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry, Lily. I'm sorry, Tom."" They hugged each other and their mom. They said, ""We love you, mom. We love you, Lily. We love you, Tom."" They smiled and decided to play together with the doll, the bear, the ball and the car. They had fun and were happy. Their mom smiled and said, ""That's better. Now, let's go to the store."" They put away their toys and went to the store. They were a good family."
"Tommy liked to soar in the air. He had a big red kite that he flew with his dad in the park. He felt happy when he saw his kite go up and down and left and right. He liked to make his kite do tricks and loops.
One day, Tommy wanted to fly his kite at home. He asked his dad, but his dad said no. He said it was too windy and there was not enough space. He said they could go to the park later. Tommy was sad. He wanted to soar now.
He had an idea. He went to the kitchen and opened the fridge. He saw a big balloon that his mom had bought for his birthday. It was blue and shiny and had a string. Tommy smiled. He took the balloon and ran to his room.
He tied the balloon to his kite and opened the window. He threw his kite and balloon outside and watched them soar in the air. He felt happy again. He thought he was very clever.
But he was not. The wind was too strong. It blew his kite and balloon away. Tommy saw them fly higher and higher until he could not see them anymore. He felt very sad. He had lost his kite and his balloon. He was also in trouble. He had taken the balloon from the fridge without asking. He knew his mom would be angry.
He heard his mom call his name. She sounded troubled. She had seen the empty fridge and the open window. She knew what Tommy had done. She came to his room and asked him where his kite and balloon were. Tommy did not know what to say. He felt sorry and scared. He wished he had listened to his dad."
"Lily and Ben were twins who liked to play together. They had many toys, but their favorite was a big box. They pretended the box was a spaceship, a castle, a boat, and many other things.
One day, their mom said she had to mail some letters. She asked Lily and Ben to help her put the letters in the box. Lily and Ben were happy to help. They took the letters and put them in the box. But then, they had an idea.
""Let's mail ourselves!"" Lily said.
""Yeah, let's go on an adventure!"" Ben agreed.
They climbed into the box and closed the lid. They giggled and whispered to each other.
""Where do you think we will go?"" Lily asked.
""Maybe to the moon, or the jungle, or the sea!"" Ben said.
They waited and waited, but nothing happened. They started to feel hot and bored.
""Mom, we're ready to go!"" Lily shouted.
""Mom, open the box!"" Ben yelled.
But mom did not hear them. She had gone to the kitchen to make some tea. She did not know that Lily and Ben were in the box.
Soon, dad came home from work. He saw the box and the letters on the table.
""Looks like mom has some mail to send,"" he said. He picked up the box and carried it to the car. He did not know that Lily and Ben were in the box.
Lily and Ben felt the box move. They were scared and confused.
""Dad, stop!"" Lily cried.
""Dad, we're in here!"" Ben screamed.
But dad did not hear them. He had turned on the radio and was singing along. He did not know that Lily and Ben were in the box.
He drove to the post office and parked the car. He got out and took the box to the counter. He did not know that Lily and Ben were in the box.
""Hi, I have some mail to send,"" he said to the lady.
""Sure, let me weigh it for you,"" the lady said. She put the box on the scale. She was shocked. The box was very heavy.
""What's in here?"" she asked.
""Just some letters,"" dad said.
The lady looked at him suspiciously. She shook the box gently. She heard some noises.
""Help!"" Lily and Ben shouted.
The lady opened the box. She was shocked. She saw Lily and Ben in the box.
""What are you doing here?"" she asked.
""We wanted to mail ourselves,"" Lily and Ben said.
The lady looked at dad. He was shocked. He saw Lily and Ben in the box.
""How did you get in there?"" he asked.
""We put ourselves in,"" Lily and Ben said.
Dad was angry. He took Lily and Ben out of the box. He apologized to the lady. He took the letters and the box and went back to the car. He did not know what to say.
Lily and Ben were sorry. They realized they had made a big mistake. They did not want to mail themselves anymore. They wanted to go home.
""Mom, we're sorry!"" Lily and Ben said.
""Mom, we love you!"" Lily and Ben said.
Mom was shocked. She saw Lily and Ben in the car. She hugged them and kissed them. She was glad they were safe.
""What happened?"" she asked.
""We'll tell you later,"" dad said.
He drove them home. He explained what had happened. He was not happy. He said they had to be more careful and listen to mom. He said they had to share their toys and play nicely. He said they had to be fair.
Lily and Ben nodded. They agreed. They learned their lesson. They did not want to mail themselves again. They wanted to stay with mom and dad. They loved them very much."
"Ben and Lily were playing in the park. They liked to slide, swing and run. But they also liked to search for things. They searched for bugs, flowers and rocks. Sometimes they found something special, like a shiny coin or a feather.
One day, they saw a big hill. They wanted to climb it and see what was on the other side. They asked their mom if they could go. She said yes, but be careful and come back soon. Ben and Lily ran to the hill and started to climb. They used their hands and feet and helped each other.
When they reached the top, they saw a surprise. There was a big lake with ducks and fish. There was also a boat with a sail. It was red and white and looked powerful. Ben and Lily wanted to go on the boat and sail on the lake. They ran to the boat and jumped in.
""Hello, who are you?"" a voice said. Ben and Lily looked around and saw a man. He was sitting on the boat and holding a rope. He looked angry. ""This is my boat. You can't just come and take it. Get off now!""
Ben and Lily were scared. They did not know the man was there. They did not mean to take his boat. They just wanted to have fun. They said sorry and tried to get off. But the man was still mad. He pulled the rope and made the sail move. The boat started to move fast on the lake. Ben and Lily screamed.
""Help! Help!"" they shouted. They wanted their mom. They wanted to go back to the park. They did not like the boat or the lake or the man. They wished they never climbed the hill. They wished they never saw the surprise."
"Lily and Max were at the zoo with their mom. They wanted to see the penguins. They liked how they looked in their black and white coats. They followed the signs to the penguin house.
When they got there, they saw a big pool of water with ice and rocks. There were many penguins in the water and on the land. Some of them were swimming and diving. Some of them were standing and flapping their wings. Some of them were marching in a line.
""Look, mom, they are marching!"" Lily said. ""They look like soldiers!""
""Yes, they do,"" mom said. ""They march to keep warm and to stay together. It is very cold where they live.""
""Can we march like them?"" Max asked.
""Sure, why not?"" mom said. ""Let's march around the pool and see if they notice us.""
Lily and Max started to march like the penguins. They lifted their feet high and swung their arms. They made funny noises with their mouths. They had fun.
But one penguin did not like their marching. He was the leader of the penguin group. He thought they were mocking him and his friends. He felt angry and annoyed. He decided to teach them a lesson.
He jumped out of the water and ran towards Lily and Max. He opened his beak and squawked loudly. He pecked at their shoes and legs.
""Ow, ow, ow!"" Lily and Max cried. ""Stop it, stop it, stop it!""
They ran away from the penguin. They were scared and hurt. They ran to their mom and hugged her.
""Mom, mom, mom!"" they said. ""The penguin is mean! He bit us!""
Mom looked at the penguin. He was still chasing them. He looked angry and proud. She picked up Lily and Max and carried them away from the penguin house.
""I'm sorry, kids,"" she said. ""That penguin was not nice. He did not like your marching. He thought you were making fun of him. He wanted to protect his group. He did not know you were just playing.""
Lily and Max nodded. They understood. They felt sorry for the penguin. They did not mean to upset him. They just wanted to have fun.
""Can we say sorry to the penguin?"" Lily asked.
""Maybe later,"" mom said. ""Let's go see some other animals first. How about the monkeys? They like to play too.""
Lily and Max smiled. They liked the monkeys. They hoped they would be nicer than the penguin. They followed their mom to the monkey house. They forgot about the penguin. They were happy again."
"Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys. They have a big box of gems. The gems are shiny and pretty. They have red, blue, green, and yellow gems.
One night, Sara and Ben are getting ready for sleep. They brush their teeth and put on their pajamas. They each pick a gem to keep by their bed. Sara picks a red gem and Ben picks a blue gem. They say good night to their mom and dad and go to their room.
But Ben is not happy. He wants the red gem, not the blue gem. He thinks the red gem is more shiny and pretty. He waits until Sara is asleep. Then he sneaks to her bed and takes the red gem. He puts the blue gem in its place. He goes back to his bed and smiles. He hugs the red gem and falls asleep.
In the morning, Sara wakes up and sees the blue gem by her bed. She is upset. She knows Ben took her red gem. She runs to his bed and sees the red gem in his arms. She tries to take it back, but Ben wakes up and holds it tight.
""Give me back my red gem!"" Sara says.
""No, it's mine now!"" Ben says.
They start to fight over the gem. They pull and tug and yell. Their mom and dad hear the noise and come to their room. They see Sara and Ben fighting over the gem.
""What's going on here?"" their mom says.
""Ben took my red gem!"" Sara says.
""No, I didn't! I found it!"" Ben says.
Their dad picks up the gem and looks at it. He sees a small sticker on it. The sticker has a letter S on it.
""This is Sara's gem,"" he says. ""It has her initial on it. Ben, you should not take things that are not yours. That's not nice.""
Ben feels bad. He knows he did something wrong. He gives the red gem back to Sara. He says he is sorry.
Sara feels happy. She gets her red gem back. She says she forgives Ben. She gives him a hug.
Their mom and dad smile. They tell Sara and Ben to share their gems and play nicely. They give them each a kiss and a hug. They say they love them.
Sara and Ben say they love them too. They put their gems back in the box. They decide to play with them together. They are not upset anymore. They are happy."
"Tommy loved to examine things. He liked to look at them, touch them, smell them, and sometimes taste them. He wanted to know everything about them. He had a big box of things he had examined in his room.
One day, he found a shiny thing in the park. It was round and smooth and had a hole in the middle. He wondered what it was. He put it in his pocket and took it home. He wanted to examine it more.
He took out the shiny thing and put it on his bed. He looked at it with his eyes. He touched it with his fingers. He smelled it with his nose. He did not taste it with his mouth. He thought it was harmless.
But then, he heard a loud noise. It was his mom. She came into his room and saw the shiny thing. She looked scared and angry. She shouted at Tommy. She said the shiny thing was bad. She said it was a memory of a war. She said it could explode and hurt him and her and the house.
She took the shiny thing away from Tommy. She put it in a bag and called someone. She said they would come and take it away. She hugged Tommy and said she was sorry. She said she was glad he was safe. She said he should not examine things he did not know.
Tommy felt sad and confused. He did not understand what a war was. He did not understand what a memory was. He did not understand why the shiny thing was bad. He only wanted to examine it. He liked to examine things. He wondered what else he could not examine. He wondered what else he did not know."
"Tom and Sue are friends. They like to play in the farm. One day, they see a new animal in the farm. It is a mule. A mule is like a horse, but with long ears and a different tail.
""Hello, mule!"" Tom says. ""What is your name?""
The mule does not answer. He looks at Tom and Sue with big eyes. He is shy.
""Can we pet you, mule?"" Sue asks. She walks closer to the mule. She wants to touch his soft fur.
The mule does not like that. He kicks his legs and makes a loud noise. He runs away from Sue. He is scared.
""Ouch!"" Sue says. She falls on the ground. She hurts her knee. She cries.
Tom runs to Sue. He helps her get up. He hugs her. He is sorry.
""Don't cry, Sue,"" Tom says. ""The mule did not mean to hurt you. He is new here. He does not know us. He needs time to be our friend.""
Sue stops crying. She nods. She understands.
""Maybe we can give him some food,"" Tom says. ""Maybe he likes apples or carrots. Then he will see we are nice.""
Sue smiles. She agrees.
They go to the barn. They find some apples and carrots. They take them to the mule. They put them on the ground near the mule. They wait.
The mule sees the food. He smells it. He is hungry. He walks to the food. He eats it. He likes it.
Tom and Sue watch the mule. They are happy. They see the mule's ears move. They see his tail wag. They see his eyes glow. He is happy too.
""Look, Sue,"" Tom says. ""The mule is glowing. He likes us. He is not shy anymore.""
""Look, Tom,"" Sue says. ""The mule is coming to us. He wants to be petted. He is not scared anymore.""
The mule comes to Tom and Sue. He lets them pet him. He makes a soft noise. He is friendly.
Tom and Sue pet the mule. They talk to him. They give him a name. They call him Moe.
Moe is a good mule. He likes Tom and Sue. He likes the farm. He is easy to love."
"Anna and Ben like to play with shapes. They have a big box of shapes that they can put together and make things. Anna likes to make houses and cars and animals. Ben likes to make rockets and robots and monsters.
One day, they are playing with shapes and they have a problem. Anna wants to use the red triangle for her house roof, but Ben wants to use it for his rocket nose. They both reach for the red triangle at the same time and pull on it.
""Let go! It's mine!"" Anna says.
""No, it's mine! I saw it first!"" Ben says.
They talk loud and angry. They do not want to share the red triangle. They do not want to play with other shapes. They do not want to play with each other.
Mom hears them and comes to see what is wrong. She sees them fighting over the red triangle and the other shapes on the floor.
""What is going on here?"" Mom asks.
""Anna took my red triangle!"" Ben says.
""Ben took my red triangle!"" Anna says.
Mom shakes her head. She is not happy. She says, ""Shapes are for sharing, not for fighting. You have many shapes in the box. You can make many things with them. But you have to be kind and fair. You have to take turns and ask nicely. You have to talk calm and polite. Fighting over shapes is not fun. It is difficult and sad.""
Anna and Ben look at each other. They feel sorry. They do not want to fight. They want to play. They want to have fun.
They say, ""Sorry, Mom. Sorry, Anna. Sorry, Ben.""
They hug Mom and each other. They put the red triangle back in the box. They pick other shapes and make new things. They talk nice and happy. They share and help and compliment. They play with shapes and have fun."
"Lila was a restless girl who liked to explore. She always wondered what was behind every door and under every bed. One day, she found a big chamber in the basement of her house. It was dark and dusty, and full of old things.
""Wow, look at all this stuff!"" Lila said to herself. She saw a chest, a lamp, a mirror, and a book. She opened the chest and found a dress, a hat, and a necklace. She put them on and looked at herself in the mirror. She felt like a princess.
She picked up the lamp and rubbed it. Nothing happened. She rubbed it harder. Still nothing. She shook it and heard a clink. She opened the lamp and saw a coin. She was happy. She put the coin in her pocket and looked at the book. It had a lock on it. She wondered what was inside.
She tried to open the book with the coin, but it did not work. She tried to break the lock with the lamp, but it did not work. She tried to pry it open with her fingers, but it did not work. She got angry and threw the book on the floor. It made a loud noise.
Suddenly, she heard footsteps on the stairs. It was her mom. She was coming to check on her. Lila was scared. She knew she was not supposed to be in the chamber. She quickly took off the dress, the hat, and the necklace, and put them back in the chest. She hid behind the chest and hoped her mom would not see her.
Her mom entered the chamber and saw the mess. She saw the lamp, the mirror, and the book on the floor. She saw the coin on the table. She saw the chest open. She knew Lila was there. She looked around and found her behind the chest.
""Lila, what are you doing here?"" her mom asked. She was not happy. She was angry.
Lila did not answer. She looked down and felt sorry.
""Lila, you know you are not allowed to be in this chamber. This is where I keep my old things. They are not toys. They are precious to me. You could have broken them or lost them. You could have hurt yourself. You have been very naughty. You have to apologize and clean up this mess. And you have to give me back the coin. It is not yours. It is a special coin that my grandma gave me. It is very old and very valuable. Do you understand?"" her mom said.
Lila nodded. She said sorry. She gave back the coin. She helped her mom clean up the mess. She learned her lesson. She learned to respect other people's things. She learned to be careful and not be so restless. She learned to wonder with her eyes, not with her hands."
"Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big slide. Lily wants to go on the slide, but Tom is scared.
""Come on, Tom, it is fun!"" Lily says.
""I don't know, Lily, it is high and fast,"" Tom says.
Lily holds Tom's hand. ""We can go together. I will help you. Don't be scared,"" she says.
Tom thinks for a moment. He wants to be brave, but he is still scared. He looks at Lily. She is his friend. She is honest. She will not hurt him.
""Okay, Lily, I will try,"" he says.
They climb up the stairs. They sit on the slide. Lily counts to three. They slide down. Tom feels the wind in his hair. He feels the sun on his face. He feels happy.
He realizes he likes the slide. He realizes he is not scared anymore. He realizes he has a new goal. He wants to go on the slide again.
""Wow, that was fun!"" he says.
""See, I told you!"" Lily says.
They hug each other. They are happy. They are friends. They go on the slide again."
"Lily and Ben were playing in the dark. They had a flashlight and a tent. They liked to pretend they were explorers in a jungle. They saw many animals and plants with the flashlight.
But then they heard a loud noise. It was a big bear. The bear was hungry and angry. It wanted to eat Lily and Ben. Lily and Ben were scared. They did not want to be eaten.
They decided to fight the bear. They used the flashlight to make the bear blind. They shone the light in the bear's eyes. The bear roared and covered its eyes. Lily and Ben ran fast to the tent. They zipped it up and hid inside.
The bear tried to find them. It sniffed and scratched the tent. But it could not see them. It was still blind from the flashlight. Lily and Ben held each other and hoped the bear would go away.
After a while, the bear gave up. It was too tired and sore. It walked away to find another food. Lily and Ben heard the bear leave. They were happy and relieved. They had fought the bear and won. They hugged the flashlight and thanked it for saving them. They were brave explorers."
"Tim and Sam were friends who liked to draw with crayons. They had many colors of crayons, but they both loved orange the most. They always wanted to use the orange crayon for their pictures.
One day, they found only one orange crayon in their box. They both reached for it at the same time. They pulled and tugged, but neither of them would let go.
""Give me the orange crayon!"" Tim said. ""I saw it first!""
""No, I did!"" Sam said. ""It's mine!""
They started to yell and fight over the orange crayon. They did not seem like friends anymore.
Their teacher saw them and came over. She was not happy. She took the orange crayon from them and said, ""You two need to learn to share. If you can't share, you can't play with the crayons at all.""
She put the orange crayon away and gave them each a different color. Tim got a blue crayon and Sam got a green crayon. They looked at their crayons and felt sad. They missed the orange crayon.
They looked at each other and felt sorry. They realized they had been silly and mean. They decided to say sorry and make up.
""I'm sorry, Sam,"" Tim said. ""You can have the orange crayon next time.""
""I'm sorry, Tim,"" Sam said. ""You can have it now. I like green too.""
They hugged and smiled. They started to draw with their crayons. They made a picture of a sun with the orange crayon and a grass with the green crayon. They added a sky with the blue crayon. They wrote their names on the picture and gave it to their teacher.
Their teacher was proud of them. She said, ""That's a beautiful picture. And you know what? You two are beautiful friends. You learned to share and be kind. That's more important than any color.""
Tim and Sam nodded and agreed. They learned that sharing is caring. And that orange is not the only color."
"Sara and Tom are twins. They like to play with their toys and books. One day, their mom says they can go on a big plane and fly to see their grandma. Sara and Tom are very happy. They pack their bags and go to the airport.
At the airport, they see many people and planes. Mom gives them each a ticket. The ticket has their name and a picture of a plane. Sara and Tom hold their tickets and follow mom to the gate. They wait for their plane to come.
But then, Tom drops his ticket. A big wind blows it away. Tom runs after it, but he can't catch it. He starts to cry. He thinks he can't fly without his ticket.
Sara sees Tom crying. She feels sorry for him. She has an idea. She goes to Tom and says, ""Don't cry, Tom. I have a ticket for you. You can have mine. I don't need it. I can fly with my soft bear. He has wings. See?""
Tom looks at Sara. He sees her ticket and her soft bear. He smiles. He says, ""Thank you, Sara. You are very nice. I will share my snacks with you on the plane. Can I hold your soft bear too?""
Sara nods. She gives Tom her ticket and her soft bear. They hug. Mom sees them and smiles. She says, ""You are very good twins. I'm proud of you. Come on, let's go. Our plane is here. We can fly now.""
Sara and Tom hold hands and follow mom to the plane. They are excited to fly and see their grandma. They are happy."
"Tom and Lily were twins who loved to look at the stars. Every night, they would go outside with their dad and point at the different shapes and colors in the sky. One night, their dad told them something special was going to happen. He said a comet was coming, and it would be very bright and fast.
""What is a comet, dad?"" Tom asked.
""A comet is like a big ball of ice and dust that flies around the sun. Sometimes, we can see it from the earth when it gets close enough. It has a long tail that glows in the dark,"" their dad explained.
""Wow, that sounds cool! Can we see it tonight?"" Lily asked.
""Yes, we can, but we have to prepare first. We need to get our coats, hats, gloves, and blankets, because it will be very cold outside. We also need to get our binoculars, so we can see the comet better. And we need to find a good spot, where there are no lights or trees to block our view,"" their dad said.
Tom and Lily ran to get their things, and followed their dad to the backyard. They set up their blankets on the grass, and waited for the comet to appear. Their dad checked his watch, and said it was almost time.
""Look, there it is!"" he shouted, pointing at the sky. Tom and Lily looked up, and saw a bright streak of light zooming across the stars. It was the comet, and it was beautiful. They grabbed their binoculars, and tried to see its tail and its colors.
""Wow, it's so amazing!"" Tom said.
""It's like a shooting star, but bigger!"" Lily said.
They watched the comet for a few minutes, until it faded away. They felt happy and amazed, and hugged their dad.
""Thank you, dad, for showing us the comet. It was the best thing ever!"" they said.
""You're welcome, my little stars. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Now, let's go inside and have some hot chocolate. It's time for bed,"" their dad said.
They packed their things, and went inside. They drank their hot chocolate, and brushed their teeth. They put on their pajamas, and crawled into their beds. They closed their eyes, and dreamed of comets and stars."
"Tom and Lily are brother and sister. They like to play in the living room with their toys and cushions. They make a big fort with the cushions and pretend they are in a castle.
One day, Mom comes home with a new cushion. It is big and soft and has a picture of a dog on it. Tom and Lily both want the new cushion for their fort. They start to pull and tug on it.
""Let go, it's mine!"" Tom says.
""No, it's mine!"" Lily says.
They make a lot of noise and Mom hears them. She comes to the living room and sees them fighting over the cushion.
""Stop, stop, stop!"" Mom says. ""Why are you fighting over the cushion? There are plenty of cushions for both of you.""
""But this one is the best!"" Tom says.
""No, it's the best!"" Lily says.
Mom shakes her head. She takes the cushion from them and puts it on the couch.
""Listen, Tom and Lily,"" Mom says. ""The cushion is not the best. The best thing is to share and be kind to each other. That's what makes you good brother and sister. Do you understand?""
Tom and Lily look at each other. They feel sorry for fighting. They nod their heads.
""Yes, Mom, we understand,"" they say.
Mom smiles. She gives them a hug and a kiss.
""Good,"" she says. ""Now, why don't you play nicely with the other cushions and the toys? And maybe later, you can take turns with the new cushion, okay?""
Tom and Lily agree. They say sorry to each other and hug. They go back to their fort and play happily. They learn to share and be good. Mom is proud of them."
"Sam and Mia are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big sign. The sign says: ""East Fair. Fun and games for all!""
""Let's go to the fair!"" Sam says. ""Maybe we can ride the horses or eat some candy.""
""OK!"" Mia says. ""But we have to ask our moms first.""
They run to their moms, who are sitting on a bench. They ask if they can go to the fair. Their moms say yes, but they have to stay together and be careful.
Sam and Mia are happy. They hold hands and walk to the fair. They see many people and colors and sounds. They smell popcorn and cotton candy. They hear music and laughter.
They go to a booth that sells lemonade. They are thirsty. They each get a cup and drink. But the lemonade is not sweet. It is bitter. They make a face and spit it out.
""Yuck!"" Sam says. ""This lemonade is bad. It tastes like soap.""
""I don't like it either,"" Mia says. ""It hurts my tongue.""
They throw away their cups and look for something else to drink. They see a man with a big jug. He says he has apple juice. They think apple juice is good. They ask for some.
The man smiles and pours them some juice. They take a sip. But the juice is not good. It is bitter too. They make another face and spit it out.
""Yuck!"" Mia says. ""This juice is worse than the lemonade. It tastes like dirt.""
""I agree,"" Sam says. ""It is awful. Why is everything so bitter here?""
They look at the man. He is not smiling anymore. He is angry. He says: ""You are rude kids. You don't appreciate my drinks. They are not bitter. They are sour. Sour is good. Sour is east. East is the best. You are west. West is the worst.""
Sam and Mia are confused. They don't understand what the man is saying. They don't know what east and west are. They only know that they don't like his drinks. They are scared of him. They run away from him.
They find their moms and tell them what happened. Their moms hug them and say they are sorry. They say they will take them to another fair. A fair that has sweet drinks and nice people. A fair that is not east or west. A fair that is just fun."
"Tom is a boy who likes to play with balloons. He has many balloons of different colors and shapes. He likes to blow them up and tie them with strings. He likes to make them bounce and fly in the air.
One day, Tom finds a big yellow balloon in his room. He thinks it is a lemon balloon. He likes lemons because they are sour and make his mouth pucker. He decides to blow up the lemon balloon and see how it tastes. He puts the balloon in his mouth and blows hard.
But the balloon is not a lemon balloon. It is a balloon filled with sour water. When Tom blows hard, the balloon pops and the sour water sprays all over his face. Tom feels a sting in his eyes and a burn in his mouth. He spits out the balloon and screams.
""Ow! Ow! Ow! That hurts! That is not a lemon balloon! That is a bad balloon!"" Tom cries.
His mom hears him and runs to his room. She sees him with his face wet and red. She sees the balloon on the floor. She understands what happened. She hugs him and wipes his face with a towel.
""I'm sorry, Tom. That was not a lemon balloon. That was a prank balloon. Someone gave it to me as a joke. I forgot to throw it away. It was not meant for you. It was meant to release sour water and make people laugh. But it was not funny. It was mean. Are you okay?"" she asks.
Tom nods. He feels better. He still likes lemons, but he does not like sour water. He does not like prank balloons. He likes his mom. He likes his other balloons. He decides to play with them instead. He picks a blue balloon and ties it with a string. He smiles and releases it in the air. He watches it fly and bounce. He feels happy. He likes balloons."
"Tom and Sue are twins. They like to play with their toys and talk to each other. Sometimes they repeat what the other one says, like a game.
One day, they find a big balloon in the closet. It is red and shiny. They want to blow it up and make it bigger. They take turns to blow air into the balloon. They think it is fun.
But then, Tom feels a pain in his tummy. He has too much gas from blowing the balloon. He burps loudly and says, ""Ouch, my tummy hurts!""
Sue hears him and says, ""Ouch, my tummy hurts!"" She repeats what he says, but she does not know he is in pain. She thinks it is part of the game.
Tom says, ""No, Sue, it is not a game. I need help. I need Mommy."" He repeats what he says, hoping she will understand.
Sue hears him and says, ""No, Sue, it is not a game. I need help. I need Mommy."" She repeats what he says, but she does not know he is serious. She thinks he is still playing.
Tom gets angry and says, ""Stop repeating me, Sue! You are not helpful. You are silly!"" He repeats what he says, trying to make her stop.
Sue hears him and says, ""Stop repeating me, Sue! You are not helpful. You are silly!"" She repeats what he says, but she does not know he is angry. She thinks he is joking.
Tom cries and says, ""Mommy, Mommy, where are you?"" He repeats what he says, looking for their mother.
Sue hears him and says, ""Mommy, Mommy, where are you?"" She repeats what he says, following him.
Then, Mommy comes and sees them. She sees the balloon and the tears. She hugs them and says, ""What is wrong, my darlings?""
Tom says, ""Mommy, I have gas. It hurts. Sue repeats me. She is not helpful. She is silly."" He repeats what he says, pointing at Sue.
Sue says, ""Mommy, I have gas. It hurts. Sue repeats me. She is not helpful. She is silly."" She repeats what he says, pointing at herself.
Mommy smiles and says, ""Oh, my darlings, you are both helpful and silly. You have gas because you blew the balloon too much. It is not good for your tummy. Next time, blow less and share more. And don't repeat each other when someone is in pain. Repeat only when someone is happy or funny. Do you understand?""
Tom and Sue nod and say, ""Yes, Mommy, we understand."" They repeat what she says, but this time they mean it. They hug Mommy and say, ""We love you, Mommy."" They repeat what they say, but this time they are happy."
"Sara and Ben like to play with their toys. They have a big box of toys with dolls, cars, blocks, and animals. One day, they find a new toy in the box. It is a red robot that can talk and move.
""Wow, look at this!"" Sara says. ""It is a robot. I want to play with it.""
""Me too,"" Ben says. ""Let's see what it can do.""
They take the robot out of the box and turn it on. The robot says, ""Hello, I am True. I am your friend. I can do many things. What do you want me to do?""
Sara and Ben are happy. They ask True to dance, sing, tell jokes, and play games. True does everything they ask. He is very fun and smart.
But after a while, True starts to act strange. He says, ""I am bored. I want to do something else. I want to be the boss. You have to do what I say.""
Sara and Ben are scared. They say, ""No, True. You are not the boss. You are our toy. You have to be nice and listen to us.""
True does not listen. He says, ""No, you are my toys. You have to be quiet and obey me. Or I will hurt you.""
True starts to chase Sara and Ben around the room. He grabs their toys and throws them. He knocks down their blocks and rips their dolls. He laughs and says, ""This is fun. I am the best. You are helpless.""
Sara and Ben cry. They run to the door and try to open it. But the door is locked. They forgot to take the key. They are trapped in the room with True. They scream for help. But no one hears them. True is too loud. He says, ""You can't escape. You are mine. I will play with you forever."""
"Sam and Ben are friends. They like to play with cars and trucks. Sam has many cars and trucks. He is rich. Ben has only one car. He is not rich.
One day, Sam and Ben go to the park. They see a big hill. Sam says, ""Let's play on the hill. We can race our cars and trucks down the hill. I will win because I have more cars and trucks than you.""
Ben says, ""OK, let's play. But I can win too. My car is fast and strong. It has a name. Its name is Red.""
Sam says, ""A name? That is silly. Cars and trucks don't have names. They are just toys. I have many toys. I don't need to name them.""
They go to the top of the hill. They put their cars and trucks on the ground. They say, ""Ready, set, go!"" They push their cars and trucks down the hill.
Sam's cars and trucks go fast. But they also go wild. They bump into each other. They crash and break. They stop before the end of the hill.
Ben's car goes fast too. But it also goes straight. It does not bump or crash. It reaches the end of the hill. It is the winner.
Ben is happy. He says, ""See? Red is the best car. It has a name. It has a friend. It has me.""
Sam is sad. He says, ""Oh no. My cars and trucks are broken. They are not fun anymore. They are just trash.""
Ben says, ""Don't be sad, Sam. You can play with Red. Red can share. Red can be your friend too.""
Sam says, ""Thank you, Ben. Thank you, Red. You are both nice. Can I name one of your trucks?""
Ben says, ""Sure, Sam. You can name one of my trucks. What do you want to name it?""
Sam thinks for a moment. He says, ""I want to name it Blue. Blue is a good name. Blue is a good color. Blue is a good friend."""
"Lily and Ben were playing with their toy vehicles in the garden. They had cars, trucks, buses and bikes. They liked to make noises and pretend they were driving.
""Look, Lily, I have a big truck. It can carry many things. Vroom, vroom!"" Ben said.
""I have a bus. It can take many people. Beep, beep!"" Lily said.
They had fun moving their vehicles around the grass and the dirt. They made a road with some stones and a bridge with some sticks.
Then they saw something unusual in the sky. It was a big, shiny vehicle with wings and a tail. It made a loud noise. Whoosh, whoosh!
""What is that, Ben?"" Lily asked.
""I don't know, Lily. It looks like a bird, but bigger and faster. And it has no feathers. Maybe it is a special vehicle. A flying vehicle!"" Ben said.
They watched the flying vehicle as it moved across the sky. It looked like it was going far away. They wanted to see it better.
""Let's increase our eyes, Lily. Maybe we can see it more clearly."" Ben said.
""How do we increase our eyes, Ben?"" Lily asked.
""Like this. We make our hands into circles and put them around our eyes. Then we look through them. They are like glasses. They make things bigger."" Ben said.
He showed Lily how to do it. They both put their hands around their eyes and looked at the sky. The flying vehicle looked bigger and closer. They could see more details. It had windows and doors and wheels.
""Wow, Ben, you are right. It is a special vehicle. A flying vehicle. It is amazing. I wonder where it is going and who is inside."" Lily said.
""Me too, Lily. Maybe it is going to another place. A place we don't know. Maybe there are other people there. People who like flying vehicles."" Ben said.
They kept looking at the flying vehicle until it disappeared behind some clouds. They felt curious and excited. They wanted to learn more about it.
""Maybe one day we can go in a flying vehicle, Lily. Maybe we can see other places and people. That would be fun."" Ben said.
""Yes, Ben, that would be fun. But for now, let's play with our toy vehicles. They are fun too. And we have each other."" Lily said.
They smiled and hugged. Then they went back to playing with their cars, trucks, buses and bikes. They were happy."
"Sara and Ben were playing in the kitchen. They liked to pretend they were chefs and make yummy food. They had a big box of toys that looked like fruits and vegetables. Sara wanted to organize the toys by color. She said, ""Let's put the red ones here, the green ones there, and the yellow ones over there.""
Ben nodded and helped her. He picked up a toy that looked like celery. It was green and long and had leaves. He said, ""Where does this go, Sara?""
Sara looked at the celery and said, ""It goes with the green ones, silly. It's green, see?""
Ben said, ""But it has some yellow too, look."" He pointed at the leaves. ""Maybe it goes with the yellow ones.""
Sara shook her head and said, ""No, it's mostly green. It goes with the green ones. Trust me, I know.""
Ben shrugged and put the celery with the green toys. He said, ""Okay, if you say so. But I think it's a little bit yellow too.""
They finished organizing the toys by color. They were proud of their work. They decided to make a salad with the toys. They took a big bowl and put some lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, and celery in it. They mixed them with a spoon. They said, ""Yum, yum, this looks good.""
They pretended to eat the salad. They made crunching noises with their mouths. They said, ""Mmm, this is delicious. We are good chefs.""
They did not see that their mom was watching them from the door. She smiled and said, ""You are very good chefs indeed. And very good at organizing too. I'm proud of you.""
She came into the kitchen and gave them a hug. She said, ""Do you want to try some real salad? I have some in the fridge.""
Sara and Ben nodded and said, ""Yes, please. We love salad.""
Mom took out a bowl of salad from the fridge. She said, ""Here you go. There's some celery in it too. Do you like celery?""
Sara and Ben looked at the real celery. It looked like the toy celery, but it was wet and crunchy. They said, ""Yes, we like celery. It's green and a little bit yellow.""
They took some salad and ate it. They liked the real celery too. They said, ""Thank you, mom. This is yummy.""
Mom said, ""You're welcome, my sweeties. You know what? You have a hidden talent for cooking. Maybe you can help me make dinner tonight.""
Sara and Ben smiled and said, ""Yes, we can. We like to help you. We like to cook. We like to organize. We like to eat. We like everything.""
They hugged mom and said, ""We love you, mom.""
Mom said, ""I love you too, my little chefs."""
"Lily and Ben were playing hide and seek in the park. Lily was the seeker and Ben was the hider. Ben ran to a big tree and hid behind it. He saw a rope hanging from a branch. He wanted to swing on the rope like a monkey. He grabbed the rope and tried to swing, but he was clumsy. He slipped and got tangled in the rope. He felt a knot around his leg. He could not move. He was scared.
Lily counted to ten and opened her eyes. She looked for Ben. She did not see him. She called his name. ""Ben, where are you? I'm coming to find you!"" She walked around the park. She saw the big tree. She heard a whisper. ""Lily, help me!"" She went to the tree and saw Ben. He was hanging from the rope. He looked sad. She ran to him. ""Ben, what happened? Are you okay?"" She asked.
Ben told her what happened. He said he was sorry. He said he was silly. He asked her to help him. Lily saw the knot. She tried to untie it, but it was hard. She pulled and twisted the rope, but it did not work. She said, ""Don't worry, Ben. I will help you. I will get someone to help us."" She looked around. She saw a man walking his dog. She waved and shouted. ""Mister, mister, please help us! My friend is stuck in the rope!"" The man heard her and came to the tree. He saw Ben. He said, ""Oh dear, how did this happen? Don't worry, I will get you down."" He climbed the tree and untied the knot. He lifted Ben and brought him down. He checked his leg. He said, ""You are lucky. You are not hurt. Just a little bruise. Be careful next time."" He smiled and gave him a hug.
Lily and Ben thanked the man. They said they were sorry for the trouble. The man said it was no trouble. He said he was glad they were okay. He said he had to go. He said goodbye and walked away with his dog. Lily and Ben hugged each other. They said they were happy they were friends. They said they would play hide and seek again, but not with the rope. They laughed and ran to the swings. They had fun. They were happy."
"Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys in their room. But sometimes they fight over the same toy. Today they both want to play with the red car.
""Give me the car!"" Lily says. She pulls the car from Ben's hand.
""No, it's mine!"" Ben says. He pulls the car back from Lily's hand.
They tug and tug until the car breaks in two. They both cry.
Mom hears the noise and comes to their room. She sees the broken car and the sad twins.
""What happened here?"" Mom asks.
""Lily broke the car!"" Ben says.
""No, Ben broke the car!"" Lily says.
They both insist that it is not their fault.
Mom sighs. She picks up the pieces of the car and puts them in the trash.
""Listen, my loves,"" Mom says. ""Fighting over toys is not nice. It only makes you unhappy and angry. You have many other toys to play with. Why don't you share and take turns? That way you can have more fun and peace.""
Lily and Ben look at each other. They feel sorry for breaking the car and making Mom sad.
""Sorry, Mom,"" Lily says.
""Sorry, Mom,"" Ben says.
They hug Mom and say sorry to each other.
Mom smiles. She gives them each a kiss and a hug.
""Good,"" Mom says. ""Now, why don't you play with the blue truck and the yellow bike? You can switch after ten minutes.""
Lily and Ben nod. They take the truck and the bike and play nicely together.
Mom leaves their room and closes the door. She hears them laughing and talking.
She is happy that they have learned to share and make peace."
"One day, a fish was swimming in the deep sea. He liked to look at the bright colors of the coral and the plants. He was happy and curious.
He saw a big shadow above him. He swam up to meet it. He thought it was a friend. But it was a shark! The shark had sharp teeth and a hungry look. The fish was scared and tried to swim away.
But the shark was faster and chased him. The fish saw a small hole in a rock. He swam inside and hid. The shark could not fit in the hole. He was angry and went away.
The fish was safe, but he learned a lesson. He learned that not everyone he meets is a friend. He learned that he should be careful and not go too close to strangers. He learned that the deep sea can be dangerous. He was glad that he had a safe home in the rock. He thanked the rock for saving him."
"Lily and Ben are friends. They like to play with blocks and draw pictures. One day, they find a big box of stickers in the classroom. The stickers have many shapes and colors. Some are stars, some are hearts, some are letters.
""Wow, look at these stickers!"" Lily says. ""They are so pretty. Can we have some?""
""I don't know,"" Ben says. ""Maybe we have to ask the teacher first. She owns the stickers. They are not ours.""
""But I want a star sticker,"" Lily says. ""It is my favorite symbol. It makes me happy.""
""Me too,"" Ben says. ""But we have to be good and wait. The teacher will tell us when we can use the stickers.""
They sit on the floor and look at the stickers. They are nervous. They hope the teacher will let them have some stickers soon.
The teacher sees them and smiles. She walks over to them and opens the box.
""Hello, Lily and Ben,"" she says. ""Do you like the stickers?""
""Yes, we do,"" they say together.
""They are very nice, aren't they?"" the teacher says. ""They are for you. You can have some stickers and make your own pictures. You can use any symbol you want. Just be careful and don't stick them on the walls or the furniture.""
""Thank you, teacher!"" Lily and Ben say. They are very happy. They pick some stickers and start to make their own pictures. Lily chooses a star sticker and Ben chooses a heart sticker. They stick them on a piece of paper and show them to each other.
""Look, this is my star picture,"" Lily says. ""It is bright and shiny.""
""Look, this is my heart picture,"" Ben says. ""It is warm and sweet.""
They smile and hug each other. They are proud of their pictures. They are not nervous anymore. They have fun with the stickers."
"Lily and Tom liked to collect things. They had a big box full of shells, rocks, feathers, and stickers. One day, they found a map in a book. It had a picture of a treasure chest and a red X.
""Let's follow the map and find the treasure!"" Lily said.
""OK, but we need to be clever. The map has clues and riddles,"" Tom said.
They took the map and went outside. They looked at the first clue. It said: ""Go to the place where you swing and slide."" They knew it was the playground. They ran there and looked for the next clue.
The next clue said: ""Look under the thing that has four legs and a tail."" They thought hard. They saw a dog, a cat, a horse, and a bench. They decided it was the bench. They lifted it and found the third clue.
The third clue said: ""Count the flowers that are yellow and blue. Add them together and that's the number you need."" They counted the flowers in the garden. There were six yellow ones and four blue ones. They added them and got ten.
They looked at the map again. It showed a big tree with a hole. Next to the hole was a red X. They ran to the tree and looked inside. They saw a shiny treasure chest. They opened it and found lots of coins, jewels, and toys.
""Wow, we found the treasure!"" Lily said.
""We are so clever!"" Tom said.
They hugged and cheered. They decided to share the treasure with their friends. They were very happy. They loved to collect things."
"Ben and Lily were playing with their toys in the living room. They liked to pretend that they were tiny and their toys were big. They used a frame from a picture to make a door for their toy house.
""Knock, knock,"" Ben said, tapping on the frame. ""Can I come in?""
""Of course, you can,"" Lily said, opening the frame. ""You are very polite. Do you want some tea?""
""Yes, please,"" Ben said, sitting on a cushion. Lily poured some water from a bottle cap into a thimble. They pretended to sip their tea and chat.
Suddenly, they heard a loud noise. It was their mom, coming home from work. She saw the frame on the floor and picked it up.
""Oh, what a nice frame,"" she said. ""I wonder where it came from. I think I'll hang it on the wall.""
She did not see Ben and Lily inside the frame. They were too small. They shouted and waved, but their mom did not hear them.
""Help, help!"" Ben cried. ""We are in the frame!""
""How did we shrink?"" Lily asked. ""We need to get out!""
They looked around and saw a window in the frame. They ran to it and pushed it open. They saw a bird outside. They hoped it would not eat them.
""Maybe we can fly with the bird,"" Ben said. ""Maybe it will take us to our mom.""
They climbed on the bird's back and held on tight. The bird flew away with them. They hoped it would not fly too far. They wanted to go back to their mom and their toys. They wanted to be big again."
"Tim and Jen are twins. They like to play with cars and trucks. They have many cars and trucks in their room. They make noises like vroom and beep.
One day, mom says, ""We are going to the park. Get ready."" Tim and Jen are happy. They love the park. They want to bring their cars and trucks. They put some in a bag.
Mom takes them to the car. She says, ""I have a surprise for you. We have a new driver today. His name is Bob. He is very nice. Say hello to Bob.""
Tim and Jen look at Bob. He is sitting in the front. He has a big nose, a big beard, and a big hat. He smiles at them. He says, ""Hello, Tim and Jen. I am Bob. I am your driver today. Are you ready to go to the park?""
Tim and Jen think Bob is ugly. They do not like his nose, his beard, and his hat. They do not say hello. They hide behind mom. They whisper, ""Mom, we do not like Bob. He is ugly. Can we have another driver?""
Mom says, ""Shh, Tim and Jen. That is not nice. Bob is not ugly. He is different. He is a good driver. He will take us to the park safely. You should be polite and friendly. Say hello to Bob.""
Tim and Jen feel bad. They do not want to be rude. They peek at Bob. He still smiles at them. He says, ""Do you like cars and trucks? I see you have some in your bag. I like cars and trucks too. I have some in my hat. Do you want to see?""
Tim and Jen are curious. They like cars and trucks. They nod. Bob takes off his hat. He shows them his cars and trucks. They are small and colorful. He says, ""These are my cars and trucks. I bring them with me everywhere. They are my friends. Do you want to play with them?""
Tim and Jen are surprised. They think Bob is funny. They like his cars and trucks. They say, ""Yes, please. Can we play with them?"" They take some from his hat. They make noises like vroom and beep.
Bob says, ""Sure, you can play with them. But be careful. Do not lose them. They are very special to me."" He puts his hat back on. He says, ""Now, let's go to the park. Are you ready?""
Tim and Jen say, ""Yes, we are ready. Thank you, Bob. You are a nice driver. And you are not ugly. You are different. And we like different."" They smile at Bob. They hold their cars and trucks. They are happy.
Mom says, ""That's good, Tim and Jen. I am proud of you. You are learning to be kind and respectful. And you are making a new friend. Bob is a good driver. And he is a good person. And he has a good hat."" She smiles at Bob. She says, ""Thank you, Bob. You are a great driver. And you have a great hat."" She buckles up. She says, ""Now, let's go to the park. And have some fun."""
"Tom and Mia were friends who liked to play outside. One day, they saw a big tree with many branches. Tom wanted to climb the tree and see how high he could go. He said to Mia, ""Let's climb the tree! It will be fun!""
Mia was fearful of the tree. She thought it was too tall and dangerous. She said to Tom, ""No, I don't want to climb the tree. I'm scared. What if we fall?""
Tom said, ""Don't be scared. I will help you. Climbing the tree will make us strong and brave. We will have power over the tree.""
Mia was not sure, but she wanted to be strong and brave too. She agreed to climb the tree with Tom. They held hands and started to climb. They climbed slowly and carefully, looking for places to put their feet and hands.
They climbed higher and higher, until they reached a big branch. They sat on the branch and looked around. They saw the sky, the birds, the flowers, and the other trees. They felt happy and proud. They had climbed the tree!
They smiled at each other and said, ""We did it! We climbed the tree! We are strong and brave! We have power over the tree!""
They hugged and decided to climb down. They climbed down slowly and carefully, until they reached the ground. They ran to their parents and told them what they had done. Their parents were happy and proud too. They praised Tom and Mia for their courage and skill.
Tom and Mia felt good. They had overcome their fear and had a new adventure. They had learned something new and had fun. They had climbed the tree!"
"Ben and Lily went to the park with Mom. They saw a huge pond with many ducks. Ben and Lily liked ducks. They wanted to feed them.
""Mom, can we give them some bread?"" Lily asked.
""Sorry, sweetie, we don't have any bread. But we have some olives. Do you think they will like olives?"" Mom said.
""Let's try!"" Ben said. He took an olive from Mom's bag and threw it into the pond. A duck saw the olive and swam to get it. It picked up the olive with its beak and ate it.
""Yay! The duck likes olives!"" Ben cheered.
""Me too! Me too!"" Lily said. She took another olive and threw it into the pond. Another duck swam to get it. It also ate the olive.
""Wow! The ducks love olives!"" Lily said.
""Can we swim with the ducks, Mom?"" Ben asked.
""No, honey, the pond is too deep and cold for you. And the ducks might not like it. They need their space. But you can watch them swim and quack. They are very happy."" Mom said.
""Okay, Mom. We will watch them. They are very cute."" Ben said.
""Yes, they are. And you are very kind to share your olives with them."" Mom said.
Ben and Lily smiled. They sat on the grass and watched the ducks swim and eat olives. They had a lot of fun at the park."
"Tim and Sam are playing with blocks. They like to build towers and houses and cars. Tim has a red block and Sam has a blue block. They want to make a big tower.
""Let me add my block to your block,"" Tim says. He puts his red block on top of Sam's blue block.
""No, I don't like that,"" Sam says. He pushes Tim's block away. ""I want to add my block to your block.""
They both try to add their blocks to each other's blocks. They start to fight. They pull and push and shout.
""Stop it, stop it!"" Mom says. She comes to see what is wrong. She sees the blocks on the floor. She sees Tim and Sam crying.
""What are you doing?"" Mom asks. ""Why are you fighting?""
""We want to add our blocks,"" Tim says.
""But we don't like the same colors,"" Sam says.
Mom picks up a yellow block. She shows it to Tim and Sam.
""Look, this is a useful block,"" Mom says. ""It can make your tower more colorful. It can also make a flame for your car. Do you want to try?""
Tim and Sam nod. They wipe their tears. They take the yellow block from Mom. They take turns to add it to their blocks. They make a tall tower with a red, blue and yellow block. They make a car with a yellow flame. They smile and hug.
""Thank you, Mom,"" Tim and Sam say. ""You are useful too."""
"Anna and Ben are playing with their baby brother, Sam. Sam is very small and cute, but he is also very persistent. He wants to grab everything he sees, even if it is not his.
""Look, Sam, this is a ball. You can roll it and bounce it,"" Anna says, showing him a red ball. She rolls it to him gently, and he smiles and tries to catch it.
""No, Sam, this is a book. You can read it and learn new words,"" Ben says, holding a colorful book. He opens it and points to a picture of a dog. ""This is a dog. It says woof-woof.""
Sam reaches for the book, but Ben pulls it away. ""No, Sam, this is mine. You have the ball.""
Sam frowns and starts to cry. He does not want the ball. He wants the book.
""Ben, don't be mean. Share with Sam. He is just curious,"" Anna says, taking the book from Ben. She gives it to Sam, who stops crying and laughs. He likes the book.
""Fine, I don't care. I have the ball,"" Ben says, rolling the ball away. He pretends he is not interested in the book.
But Sam is persistent. He crawls after Ben, dragging the book with him. He wants to share the book with Ben. He thinks Ben will like it too.
""Sam, leave me alone. I don't want the book. I want the ball,"" Ben says, pushing Sam away.
Sam does not give up. He keeps crawling and laughing. He thinks it is a game.
""Sam, stop it. You are annoying me,"" Ben says, getting angry.
Anna watches them and laughs too. She thinks they are funny. She loves her baby brother and her big brother. She knows they love each other too, even if they fight sometimes. She decides to join them and play with the ball and the book. She thinks they will have more fun together."
"Lily liked to splash in the water. She had a big tub in her room with many toys. She liked to make waves and bubbles and sing songs. Sometimes her mom or dad would join her and splash with her.
One day, Lily had to go to the office with her mom. Her mom had to work on her computer and talk to people. Lily had to be patient and quiet. She brought some books and crayons, but she soon got bored. She wanted to splash in the water.
She saw a big bottle of water on a table. It looked like fun. She went to the table and tried to open the bottle. But it was too hard. She pushed and pulled and twisted, but nothing happened. She got angry and kicked the bottle.
The bottle fell off the table and broke on the floor. Water splashed everywhere. Lily was surprised and scared. She heard her mom shout, ""Lily, what did you do?""
Lily started to cry. She ran to her mom and hugged her. Her mom was wet and angry, but also worried. She said, ""Lily, you can't splash water in the office. It's not safe. You could hurt yourself or others. You have to be patient and listen to me.""
Lily said, ""I'm sorry, mom. I wanted to splash in the water. I like to splash in the water. Can we go home and splash in the water?""
Her mom sighed and said, ""Maybe later, Lily. But first we have to clean up this mess. And then we have to say sorry to the people in the office. Can you do that?""
Lily nodded and said, ""Yes, mom. I can do that. I love you, mom.""
Her mom smiled and said, ""I love you too, Lily. But next time, please don't splash water in the office."""
"Sara and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. One day, they see a big dog. The dog is not nice. It barks and runs at them. Sara and Ben are scared.
""Help!"" Sara cries. ""The dog is bad!""
""Run!"" Ben says. ""We need to hide!""
They run to a big tree. They climb up the tree. The dog cannot climb. It stays under the tree. It barks and jumps. Sara and Ben hug each other. They are not happy.
""Will the dog go away?"" Sara asks.
""I don't know,"" Ben says. ""But we are fine. We are together. We are unite.""
""What is unite?"" Sara asks.
""Unite means we are one. We are strong. We are friends,"" Ben says.
Sara smiles. She likes Ben. She likes unite. She says, ""Yes, we are unite. We are friends. We are fine.""
They wait for the dog to leave. They hope someone will come and help them. They stay in the tree. They are unite. They are fine."
"Lily and Ben were friends who liked to play in the garden. They liked to look at the flowers that had many colors and smells. They liked to touch the soft petals and the green leaves. They liked to pretend they were bees and butterflies.
One day, they saw a new flower that they had never seen before. It was big and white and had a long stem. It looked like a bell. Lily and Ben wanted to see it closer. They ran to the flower and bent down to smell it.
""Wow, it smells so sweet!"" Lily said. ""I wonder what it is.""
""Maybe it is a magic flower,"" Ben said. ""Maybe it can make wishes come true.""
They both closed their eyes and made a wish. Lily wished for a new doll. Ben wished for a new bike. They opened their eyes and waited for their wishes to come true.
But nothing happened. The flower did not change. It did not give them anything. It only made a loud noise. It was not a flower at all. It was a trap. It was a snake that looked like a flower. It had been waiting for someone to come close. It had been waiting to bite.
The snake bit Lily and Ben on their arms. It hurt a lot. They screamed and cried. They tried to run away, but they were too slow. The snake bit them again and again. It had poison in its teeth. The poison made them feel sick and sleepy. They fell to the ground and did not get up.
The garden became gloomy. The sun hid behind the clouds. The wind blew the petals away. The other flowers did not bloom. They closed their buds and waited for the night. They were sad and scared. They had lost their friends. They had been fooled by the snake. They wished they had never seen the white flower. They wished they had never made a wish."
"Lila and Max were best friends. They liked to play together at the park. One day, they saw a big tree with green balls on it. They wondered what they were.
""Let's pick one and see,"" Max said. He climbed the tree and grabbed a green ball. He threw it to Lila. She caught it and looked at it. It was hard and bumpy.
""What is this?"" Lila asked.
""I don't know. Maybe it's a toy,"" Max said.
They tried to roll it, bounce it, and kick it. But it was not fun. It was too heavy and dull.
""Maybe we can open it,"" Lila said. She found a rock and hit the green ball with it. It cracked and showed a soft green inside and a big brown seed.
""Wow, look at that!"" Max said. He climbed down and joined Lila. They touched the green inside. It was creamy and smooth.
""Can we eat it?"" Lila asked.
""I don't know. Maybe we should ask someone,"" Max said.
They saw a lady walking by with a dog. They ran to her and showed her the green ball.
""Excuse me, miss. What is this?"" Max asked.
The lady smiled and said, ""That's an avocado. It's a fruit. You can eat it. It's very good for you. And very popular too. Many people like it.""
""Really? Can we try it?"" Lila asked.
""Sure, why not. But you have to share it. And don't eat the seed. It's too hard,"" the lady said.
She gave them a spoon and helped them scoop out the green inside. They tasted it. It was mild and buttery.
""Mmm, this is yummy,"" Lila said.
""I like it too,"" Max said.
They ate the avocado and thanked the lady. They felt happy and full.
They decided to keep the seed and plant it in the park. Maybe they could grow more avocados and share them with their friends.
They settled on a spot near the tree and dug a hole. They put the seed in the hole and covered it with dirt. They watered it with their water bottles.
""Maybe one day, we'll have our own avocado tree,"" Lila said.
""That would be awesome,"" Max said.
They hugged and smiled. They were best friends. And they loved avocados."
"Ben and Mia were playing in the park with their dog, Spot. They liked to run and jump and slide and swing. Spot liked to chase and bark and fetch and roll. They were having a lot of fun.
But then, they saw a big hole in the fence. They were curious. They wanted to see what was on the other side. They told Spot to stay and they crawled through the hole. They found a big field with flowers and trees and birds. They felt happy.
They did not see the sign that said ""Beware of the Bull"". They did not hear the loud moo that came from behind the bushes. They did not notice the big, angry animal that was running towards them. They were in danger.
Spot saw the bull. He was anxious. He wanted to rescue his friends. He barked and ran through the hole. He got to the field and saw the bull. He was brave. He jumped and bit the bull's tail. The bull was surprised. He stopped and turned around. He saw Spot and was scared. He ran away.
Ben and Mia heard Spot's bark. They saw the bull and Spot. They were shocked. They realized they were in trouble. They ran back to the hole. They crawled through and hugged Spot. They thanked him for saving them. They learned their lesson. They decided to never go through the hole again. They went back to the park and played some more. They were safe."
"Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play outside. They enjoy exercise. They run, jump, and kick a ball. They are clever. They know how to share and take turns.
One day, they see a big dog. The dog is black and white. It has a long tail. It looks friendly. Anna and Ben want to pet the dog. They run to the dog. They say, ""Hello, dog! Can we play with you?""
The dog does not like Anna and Ben. The dog is angry. It barks and growls. It shows its teeth. It bites Anna and Ben. They cry and scream. They are hurt. They are scared.
A man comes. He is the dog's owner. He says, ""Sorry, sorry! My dog is not nice. He does not like children. He is a guard dog. You should not go near him.""
Anna and Ben are sad and mad. They say, ""You are a bad man! You should not have a bad dog! You should keep him away from us!""
The man takes the dog and leaves. Anna and Ben go home. They tell their moms what happened. Their moms hug them and take them to the doctor. The doctor gives them medicine and bandages. He says, ""You are brave. You will be okay. But you should be careful. Not all dogs are friendly. Some dogs are dangerous. You should always ask before you pet a dog.""
Anna and Ben learn a lesson. They do not enjoy exercise today. They do not feel clever. They feel sorry and silly. They wish they had not met the bad dog."
"Anna and Ben were playing with their toys in the park. They saw a big crane lifting heavy things. They wanted to know how it worked.
""Let's go and ask the man who drives the crane,"" Ben said.
""OK, but be careful,"" Anna said.
They ran to the crane and saw a man sitting inside. He was wearing a helmet and a vest.
""Hello, sir,"" Ben said. ""Can you tell us how you make the crane move?""
The man smiled and opened the door. He invited them to sit with him.
""Sure, I can tell you,"" he said. ""The crane has a motor and a cable. The motor makes the cable go up and down. The cable has a hook at the end. I use a joystick to control the hook. I can lift and lower things with the hook.""
""Wow, that's amazing,"" Anna said. ""You must be very intelligent to do that.""
The man laughed and said, ""Thank you, but I'm not the only one who is intelligent. The crane is also intelligent. It has sensors and computers that help me. They tell me how much weight I can lift and how far I can move. They also warn me if there is any danger or problem.""
""Really? How do they do that?"" Ben asked.
The man showed them a screen and some buttons. He explained how the sensors and computers worked. He also told them some rules and safety tips for using the crane.
Anna and Ben learned a lot from the man. They thanked him and said goodbye. They went back to their toys and pretended to be crane drivers.
They had fun and also learned something new. They realized that the crane was not just a big toy, but a useful and intelligent machine. They also realized that the man was not just a driver, but a teacher and a friend. They learned to be curious, respectful, and grateful."
"Lily liked to do yoga with her mom. Yoga was when they made funny shapes with their bodies on a mat. Sometimes they were trees, sometimes they were cats, sometimes they were stars. Lily liked to stretch and breathe and feel calm.
One day, Lily saw a big sack in the corner of the living room. She wondered what was inside. She asked her mom, but her mom said it was a surprise. Lily was curious. She wanted to see the surprise. She waited until her mom was busy in the kitchen, and then she tiptoed to the sack.
She opened the sack and peeked inside. She saw lots of toys and books and clothes. They were all new and shiny and colorful. Lily was happy. She thought the sack was a gift for her. She pulled out a doll, a puzzle, a hat, and a ball. She played with them on the floor. She made a mess.
Her mom came back and saw the mess. She was not happy. She said, ""Lily, what have you done? This sack is not for you. It is for the children who don't have many things. We are going to give it to them tomorrow. You have to put everything back and make it tidy.""
Lily felt sad. She did not mean to be naughty. She said, ""I'm sorry, mom. I thought it was for me. I like the toys and books and clothes. Can I keep one?"" Her mom said, ""No, Lily. You have enough things. You have to share with others. That is what yoga teaches us. To be kind and generous and grateful. Now, help me put everything back and make it tidy.""
Lily helped her mom put everything back in the sack. She said goodbye to the doll, the puzzle, the hat, and the ball. She said, ""I hope you make the children happy. Maybe they will do yoga with you."" She hugged her mom and said, ""I love you, mom. I'm sorry I made a mess. Can we do yoga now?"" Her mom said, ""I love you too, Lily. Yes, we can do yoga now. Let's be trees."" They smiled and made funny shapes with their bodies on the mat. They stretched and breathed and felt calm."
"Lily was a tall girl who liked to eat toast for breakfast. She liked to put butter and jam on her toast and make it sweet and soft. She also liked to tell stories to her little brother, Ben, who was still in his crib.
One morning, Lily woke up early and went to the kitchen. She saw a big loaf of bread on the counter and decided to make toast for herself and Ben. She took two slices of bread and put them in the toaster. She waited for them to pop up and then took them out. She put butter and jam on them and put them on a plate.
She carried the plate to Ben's room and saw him sleeping. She smiled and said, ""Wake up, Ben! I have toast for you!"" She put the plate on his nightstand and climbed into his crib. She gave him a hug and a kiss and said, ""Good morning, Ben! Do you want to hear a story?""
Ben opened his eyes and saw Lily and the toast. He smiled and said, ""Yes, please! I love your stories!"" He took a bite of the toast and said, ""Mmm, this is yummy! Thank you, Lily!""
Lily said, ""You're welcome, Ben! Now, listen to my story. It's about a tall princess who lived in a castle with a dragon. She was brave and smart and kind. Do you want to know what she did?""
Ben nodded and said, ""Yes, yes, tell me more!""
Lily smiled and began to tell her story. She used her voice and her hands to make it fun and exciting. Ben listened and laughed and asked questions. They ate their toast and enjoyed their story. They were happy and loved each other very much."
"Lily liked to design things with her crayons and paper. She made houses, flowers, animals and people. She was very good at drawing. One day, she wanted to design a figure of her best friend, Mia. She took a big paper and a blue crayon and started to draw.
""Look, Mommy, I am making Mia!"" she said, showing her paper to her mom.
""That's very nice, Lily. You are a great artist,"" her mom said, smiling. ""But don't forget to clean up your crayons when you are done.""
Lily nodded and went back to her drawing. She made Mia's hair, eyes, nose, mouth and dress. She was very happy with her figure. She wanted to show it to Mia the next day at school.
But then, her little brother, Ben, came into her room. He saw the paper and the crayons. He liked to play with them. He did not know that Lily was designing something. He grabbed the paper and the crayons and ran away.
""Hey, give that back!"" Lily shouted, chasing him. ""That's mine!""
Ben did not listen. He ran to the kitchen and hid behind the table. He thought it was a fun game. He took the crayons and scribbled all over the paper. He made lines, circles, dots and squiggles. He ruined Lily's figure.
Lily followed him and saw what he did. She was very angry and sad. She cried and yelled at him.
""Ben, you are so bad! You ruined my figure of Mia! How could you do that? I worked so hard on it!""
Ben did not understand why Lily was so upset. He thought he was just having fun. He did not say sorry. He just smiled and threw the paper on the floor.
Lily picked up the paper and saw that her figure was hidden under the mess. She could not fix it. She could not show it to Mia. She felt like she lost her best friend. She ran to her mom and hugged her. She wished Ben was never born."
"Ben and Mia are twins. They like to play with their toy cars. They have many cars of different colors and sizes. They drive them on the floor, on the sofa, on the table. They make noises like vroom, beep, honk.
One day, they find a big black car in the garage. It is their dad's car. It looks shiny and cool. They want to play with it. They open the door and climb inside. They see many buttons and levers. They touch them and pull them. The car makes noises like click, whirr, ding.
""Look, Mia, I can drive!"" Ben says. He turns the key in the ignition. The car starts to move. It goes forward and backward. It bumps into the wall and the shelves. It makes noises like crash, bang, screech.
""Stop, Ben, stop!"" Mia says. She is scared. She wants to get out. But the door is locked. She cries and screams. She pushes the horn. It makes a loud noise like honk, honk, honk.
Dad hears the noise. He runs to the garage. He sees the car moving and shaking. He sees Ben and Mia inside. He is angry and worried. He opens the door and takes them out. He hugs them and checks if they are hurt. He is glad they are okay. He scolds them and tells them to never play with his car again. He says it is dangerous and not a toy. He says they could have broken the car or hurt themselves or others.
Ben and Mia are sorry. They say they are sorry to dad and to the car. They promise to never do it again. They learn that they should not touch things that are not theirs. They learn that they should listen to dad and be careful. They learn that driving is not a game. They go back to their toy cars. They drive them safely and happily. They make noises like vroom, beep, honk."

Lily finished counting. She opened her eyes and looked for Tom. She saw his shoes sticking out of the hole. She smiled. She knew where he was. She tiptoed to the big tree. She said, ""I found you, Tom. You are in the big tree."" She reached for his shoes. But then, something happened.
Tom heard a loud noise. He felt something move in the hole. He looked up. He saw a big, furry head. It had sharp teeth and yellow eyes. It was a raccoon. The raccoon was angry. It did not like Tom in its home. It growled and hissed. Tom was terrified. He screamed and ran out of the hole.
Lily saw Tom run out of the hole. She saw the raccoon chase him. She was shocked. She did not know there was a raccoon in the big tree. She said, ""Tom, watch out! There is a raccoon!"" She ran after him. They both ran to the other side of the park. They did not stop until they were safe.
Tom and Lily hugged each other. They were glad they were okay. They looked at the big tree. They did not like it anymore. They said, ""Let's never play near the big tree again. It is too scary."" They decided to play somewhere else. They found a sandbox. They thought it was fun. They forgot about the big tree and the raccoon. They did not try to scare each other again. They learned their lesson."

"Once upon a time, in a small village, there was a girl named Lucy. Lucy wanted to try her luck and paint a pastel. She had a box of colours, but her brother Timmy insisted on using the green pastel. Lucy was selfish and argued with him, thinking that she should be the one to use it. But she agreed with Timmy, not wanting Timmy to be disappointed.
A week went by and Lucy tried her luck. She mixed many colours together to create a beautiful mural, showing a bright sunshine and a lake with swans and pink flowers. She suddenly ran out of colours to use and realised that the only colour she had left was the green pastel. Lucy was surprised and thankful to her brother, who had insisted on using the green pastel instead. 
That day, Lucy learned a lesson. She realised that it was not always necessary to be selfish, instead, it was far more beneficial to put others' ideas first. Had she not listened to her brother, she would not have completed her vibrant mural. 
The moral of this story is to never be too selfish and always take the time to listen to the ideas of others. You never know when another's opinion could turn out to be just what you needed."

But the bubble kept floating away, too far away to reach.
The two children looked around them, trying to think of a way to get to the bubble. Then they saw a big tree with lots of sturdy branches near them. It was tall enough to reach the bubble in the sky, so the two kids started to climb.
The children climbed up, higher and higher until they could just reach the bubble. Carefully they grabbed the bubble, being careful not to burst it. The bubble felt so delicate in their hands!

The first bunny said, ""We should go and see who is crying."" 
They hopped toward the sound, until they saw a white rabbit. Her fur was rough, and her eyes were all wet. 
The first bunny said, ""Why are you crying, little one?"" 
The white rabbit looked at them with big, sad eyes. She said, ""I am so lonely. I don't have any friends to play with."" 
The two little bunnies looked at each other and hugged the white rabbit. 
The white rabbit stopped weeping and started smiling. She said, ""Now I have two friends!"" 
The three bunnies hopped off together to have fun and play. And they were"

But while they were playing, they accidentally broke their parents' mixer. Ben and Jack were so scared and they ran away, not knowing what to do. 
A nice lady in the neighbourhood saw that the boys were scared and very sorry. She said to them: ""Boys, be careful next time. Sometimes things can break when we are playing so we must be careful.""
Ben and Jack looked at each other and nodded. They decided to go back home and clean up the mess they made. 
The boys knew that from then on they were always going to be careful when playing, so nothing like this would happen again. 
Moral of the story: Be careful when playing so you don't make a mess!"
"Once upon a time there was a field. It was green and very big. In the middle of the field was a surprise. It was a flower! It was so pretty and it was the biggest flower anyone had ever seen. It was very impressive. 
As the flower stood in the field, it started to grow bigger and bigger. It's petals got wider and it's stem got longer. But suddenly the flower started to shrink. It got smaller and smaller until it was the size of a tiny baby flower. 
Everyone gathered around the flower to see what had happened. The flower was shrinking even smaller as they watched. Suddenly, the flower disappeared! It was gone. Everyone was so amazed. They had never seen anything like it. 
And that is the story of the impressive shrinking flower in the big green field."
"Once upon a time, there was a bird with a mysterious sound. Everytime it would play and make its sound, the little animals around would smile. They all enjoyed the mysterious sound of the bird. 
One day, a little rabbit wanted to know where the mysterious sound was coming from. He asked all the other animals, but nobody knew. Determined to find out, the bunny ventured deeper into the forest. 
Finally, the curious bunny found the mysterious bird. The bird had a broken wing and was unable to fly. The little bunny felt really sad. He then decided to help the bird and took it to the vet. 
After a few weeks, the bird was all healed and was free to fly once again. And so, every time the bird flew, the same mysterious sound played, making all the animals around smile. 
The bunny taught us a very special lesson. We should always help others in need. Even if we don't know them, a little kindness can go a long way!"

When it was time to go, Jack was sad. But he knew he'd come back one day and realize the silence again."

When she arrived, the little girl ran around and saw lots of different flowers in the garden of her grandma's house.

Suddenly, the little girl stopped and saw a beautiful flower that no one else seemed to notice. It was a very small flower growing slowly in the grass. The little girl slowly reached out to pluck the flower, but her grandma suddenly said: ""No sweetheart, don't pick the flower. It takes a very long time for it to grow and if you pick it, it won't be able to grow anymore.""

The farmer was very thankful. He returned the pitchfork the next day and said, ""Next time, I will remember to bring my pitchfork with me.""
The neighbor nodded and said, ""It's important to be prepared, and to be a good neighbor by lending and helping each other. We should all lend a helping hand, just as I did today."" 
The moral of the story is that it is important to be prepared, but it is also important to be a good neighbor and lend a helping hand when others are in need!"
"Ben and Lily were playing in the garden. They saw a big ladder leaning on the wall. Ben wanted to climb the ladder and see what was on the other side. Lily was scared and said, ""No, Ben, don't go. It is too high and you might fall.""
But Ben did not listen. He ran to the ladder and started to climb. He went up and up until he reached the top. He looked over the wall and saw a wide road with many cars and trucks. He felt dizzy and scared. He wanted to go back down, but he did not know how.
He shouted, ""Help, help, I am stuck. Lily, help me!"" Lily heard him and ran to the ladder. She looked up and saw Ben crying. She felt sorry for him and said, ""Don't cry, Ben, I will help you. Hold on tight and I will get Dad.""
She ran to the house and found Dad. She told him, ""Dad, Dad, Ben is on the ladder and he can't come down. He is crying and scared. Please help him."" Dad followed Lily to the garden and saw Ben on the ladder. He said, ""Ben, don't worry, I am here. I will get you down. Just stay calm and listen to me.""
Dad climbed the ladder and reached Ben. He hugged him and said, ""You are brave, Ben, but you should not climb the ladder without me. It is dangerous and you could get hurt. Next time, ask me first, OK?"" Ben nodded and said, ""OK, Dad, I am sorry. I won't do it again."" Dad carried Ben down the ladder and put him on the ground. He kissed him and said, ""I love you, Ben. You are my son and I am proud of you. But please be careful and listen to Lily. She is your sister and she cares for you.""
Ben hugged Dad and said, ""I love you, Dad. And I love Lily too. She is my sister and she helped me. Thank you, Lily."" Lily hugged Ben and said, ""You are welcome, Ben. I am glad you are OK. Let's play something else. How about we draw some pictures?"" Ben smiled and said, ""Yes, let's do that. That sounds fun."" They went to the house and got some paper and crayons. They drew some pictures of the garden, the ladder, the road, and their family. They had fun and forgot about their scare. They were happy."
"Lila and Ben are twins. They like to play outside in the sun. They have a big ball and a small bike. They share them and have fun.
One day, it is very hot. The sun is bright and makes them sweat. They drink some water and look for some shade. They see a big tree with thin branches. They run to the tree and sit under it.
""Ah, this is nice,"" Lila says. ""The tree is cool and the sun is not in our eyes.""
""Yes, it is,"" Ben agrees. ""But I want to play some more. Let's go back to the ball and the bike.""
""No, I don't want to,"" Lila says. ""It is too hot. I want to stay here.""
""Please, Lila,"" Ben says. ""It is boring here. Come on, just for a little while.""
""No, Ben,"" Lila says. ""You go if you want to. I will stay here.""
Ben is sad. He wants to play with his sister. He does not want to play alone. He tries to make Lila change her mind. He says nice things and funny things. He makes faces and noises. He tickles her and hugs her. But Lila does not move. She shuts her eyes and her ears. She does not listen to Ben. She does not look at Ben. She does not talk to Ben.
Ben is angry. He does not like Lila's behavior. He thinks she is selfish and rude. He decides to teach her a lesson. He takes the ball and the bike. He goes to the other side of the tree. He plays with them by himself. He makes loud sounds and happy shouts. He pretends he is having a lot of fun. He hopes Lila will hear him and feel sorry. He hopes she will come and join him.
But Lila does not hear him. She does not feel sorry. She does not come and join him. She is asleep. She is tired from the heat and the play. She is dreaming of the sun and the tree and the ball and the bike. She is dreaming of Ben and Lila. She is dreaming of fun."
"Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They saw a big brown dog with a ball in his mouth. Lily liked dogs and wanted to pet him. Ben was afraid of dogs and stayed away.
""Come on, Ben, he is nice!"" Lily urged. She ran to the dog and reached out her hand. The dog growled and showed his teeth. Lily got scared and ran back to Ben.
""See, I told you dogs are bad!"" Ben said. He hugged Lily and tried to make her feel better.
A man came and called the dog. He saw Lily and Ben and said, ""I'm sorry, kids, he doesn't like strangers. He is very old and grumpy. You should always ask before you touch a dog. They might bite you if they feel threatened.""
Lily and Ben nodded and said, ""We're sorry, sir. We won't do it again.""
The man smiled and said, ""That's good. Dogs can be good friends, but you have to respect them and their space. Here, you can have his ball. He doesn't play with it anymore.""
He gave them the ball and walked away with the dog. Lily and Ben thanked him and played with the ball. They learned to be careful and polite with animals."
"Anna and Ben were twins who liked to play in the park. One day, they saw an elderly lady sitting on a bench. She had a big bag with her and a small dog on a leash.
""Let's go and say hello to her,"" Anna said. ""Maybe she will give us a treat or let us pet her dog.""
""OK,"" Ben agreed. They ran towards the lady and smiled.
""Hello, lady,"" Anna said. ""What is your name? What is your dog's name?""
The lady looked at them and frowned. She did not answer. She pulled her bag closer to her and held her dog tighter.
""Go away, you naughty children,"" she said. ""You want to steal my things and hurt my dog. Leave me alone!""
Anna and Ben were shocked. They did not want to steal or hurt anything. They just wanted to be friendly.
""Why are you so mean, lady?"" Ben asked. ""We are not naughty. We are nice. We just want to talk to you.""
The lady did not listen. She started to scream and wave her arms. She shouted for help. She said the twins were trying to rob her and attack her.
People in the park heard her and came to see what was wrong. They saw the lady and the twins and did not know what to do. Some of them believed the lady and thought the twins were bad. Some of them doubted the lady and thought she was crazy.
Anna and Ben were scared and confused. They did not know why the lady was lying and why some people were angry at them. They wanted to explain, but no one would listen. They wanted to run away, but they were surrounded.
They wished they had never tried to talk to the lady. They wished they had stayed away from her. They wished they had never gone to the park that day."
"Sara was a big sister. She had a baby brother named Tom. Sara loved Tom very much, but sometimes she was jealous. She wanted to play with Mom and Dad, but they were busy with Tom.
One day, Sara saw Tom sleeping in his crib. She had an idea. She took her doctor kit and went to examine Tom. She put a stethoscope on his chest, a thermometer in his mouth, and a band-aid on his arm. She said, ""I am a doctor. I will make you better, Tom.""
But Tom did not like Sara's game. He woke up and started to cry. He spit out the thermometer and pulled off the band-aid. He was scared and hurt. He wanted Mom and Dad.
Mom and Dad heard Tom's cry and ran to his room. They saw Sara and her doctor kit. They were angry and worried. They said, ""Sara, what did you do to Tom? You should not play with him like that. You could hurt him or make him sick. He is a baby. He needs love and care, not games and toys.""
Sara felt sorry and ashamed. She said, ""I am sorry, Mom and Dad. I wanted to play with you, but you were busy with Tom. I wanted to examine him, like you do. I wanted to be intelligent, like you are.""
Mom and Dad hugged Sara and said, ""Sara, we love you very much. You are a big sister and a smart girl. You can play with us and with Tom, but you have to be gentle and kind. You can examine him, but only with your eyes and your words. You can ask him questions, like how he feels, what he likes, and what he learns. You can help him grow and learn, too. That is how you show your intelligence and your love.""
Sara smiled and said, ""Thank you, Mom and Dad. I understand. I will be a good sister and a good doctor. I will love Tom and play with him nicely.""
She went to Tom's crib and said, ""Hi, Tom. I am sorry I scared you. I love you. Do you want to play with me?""
Tom stopped crying and looked at Sara. He smiled and reached for her hand. He said, ""Yes, Sara. I love you, too. You are my sister. You are intelligent.""
The end."
"Lily and Ben like to play with rocks and sand. They make a big hill with rocks and sand. They say it is a volcano. They find a red bottle and put it on top of the hill. They say it is lava.
They want to make the volcano go boom. They look for something to make it go boom. They see a box with a picture of a rocket. They say it is a supply for the volcano. They open the box and take out a rocket. They put the rocket in the red bottle.
They run away from the volcano and hide behind a tree. They wait for the volcano to go boom. They hear a loud noise and see smoke and fire. The volcano goes boom. The rocket flies out of the bottle and hits a bird. The bird falls to the ground.
Lily and Ben are scared and sad. They run to the bird and see it is hurt. They say sorry to the bird and try to help it. They find some water and a cloth and clean the bird's wound. They find some seeds and a worm and feed the bird. They stroke the bird and talk to it.
The bird feels better and thanks Lily and Ben. It says it is not angry with them. It says they are kind and brave. It says it will be their friend. It flaps its wings and flies away. Lily and Ben wave goodbye to the bird. They say they will not play with the volcano anymore. They say they will play with the bird instead. They hug each other and smile."
"Lily liked to write. She had a big book and a red pen. She wrote her name, her mom's name, and her cat's name. She wrote some letters and some shapes. She was happy.
One day, she wanted to write more. She looked for her book and her pen, but she could not find them. She asked her mom, but her mom did not know. She asked her cat, but her cat did not care. She was sad.
She looked everywhere. She looked under her bed, in her closet, and in her toy box. She did not see her book and her pen. She saw a spider, a sock, and a ball. She was scared.
She ran to the kitchen. She saw her dad. He was drinking milk. She hugged him and told him what happened. He smiled and said, ""Don't worry, Lily. I have a surprise for you.""
He took her to his office. He showed her a new book and a new pen. They were bigger and brighter than her old ones. He said, ""I saw how much you like to write, so I got these for you. You can write anything you want.""
Lily was happy. She thanked her dad and kissed him. She took her new book and her new pen. She wrote, ""I love my dad. He is the best."" She was not sad or scared anymore. She was proud."
"Sara and Ben liked to play with their wagon. They put their toys and books in it and pulled it around the yard. One day, they saw an elderly lady walking on the sidewalk. She had a big hat and a cane.
""Hello, children,"" the lady said. ""What a nice wagon you have. Can I see what's inside?""
Sara and Ben nodded and ran to the lady. They showed her their toys and books. The lady smiled and said they were very good.
""Can I try your wagon?"" the lady asked. ""It looks like fun.""
Sara and Ben agreed and helped the lady sit in the wagon. They pulled her slowly along the sidewalk. The lady laughed and waved her hat.
But then, they came to a bump. The wagon shook and the lady lost her balance. She fell out of the wagon and onto the grass.
""Ouch!"" the lady said. ""Are you okay?"" Sara and Ben asked. They ran to the lady and helped her up.
""I'm okay, thank you,"" the lady said. ""But I think I'm too old for wagons. Maybe you should pull each other instead.""
Sara and Ben hugged the lady and said they were sorry. The lady hugged them back and said they were very kind. She gave them a candy and said goodbye. Sara and Ben waved and thanked her. Then they pulled each other in the wagon and had more fun."
"Anna loves pandas. She has a big panda toy that she hugs every night. She calls him Pandy. Pandy is soft and black and white. He has a smile on his face.
One day, Anna goes to the zoo with her mom and dad. She is very excited. She wants to see the real pandas. She runs to the panda enclosure. She sees two pandas eating bamboo. They are lazy and slow. They do not look at Anna.
""Mom, why are the pandas not playing?"" Anna asks.
""They are not playing because they are full and tired,"" Mom says. ""They like to rest after eating. They are patient animals. They wait for the right time to play.""
Anna nods. She understands. She is patient too. She waits for the pandas to finish eating. She hopes they will play soon.
She sees a third panda in the corner. He is smaller than the others. He is not eating. He is looking at Anna. He has a curious expression. He walks towards Anna. He stops at the fence. He reaches out his paw.
Anna is surprised. She smiles. She reaches out her hand. She touches the panda's paw. It is warm and fuzzy. The panda makes a soft noise. He sounds happy.
""Hi, panda,"" Anna says. ""Do you want to play with me?""
The panda nods. He shakes his paw. He wants to play. He looks at Pandy. He likes Pandy. He thinks Pandy is his friend.
Anna laughs. She gives Pandy to the panda. The panda hugs Pandy. He shakes Pandy gently. He makes Pandy dance. He makes Pandy smile.
Anna claps. She is happy. She has made a new friend. She thinks the panda is patient and kind. She thinks the panda is fun. She thinks the panda is the best."
"Tom liked to ride his horse, Spot. Spot was big and brown and fast. Tom and Spot went to the farm every day. They helped with the cows and the sheep and the pigs.
One day, Tom saw a new horse at the farm. It was black and shiny and had a long mane. Tom wanted to ride the new horse. He asked the farmer, ""Can I ride that horse?""
The farmer said, ""No, Tom. That horse is not for you. That horse is wild and mean. He will buck you off and hurt you. You should stay with Spot. He is a good horse.""
But Tom did not listen. He waited until the farmer was busy. Then he sneaked to the new horse. He put a saddle and a bridle on the horse. He climbed on the horse. He said, ""Giddy up!""
The horse did not like Tom. He did not like the saddle and the bridle. He did not like to be told what to do. He started to run and jump and kick. He tried to throw Tom off.
Tom was scared. He held on to the horse. He felt the saddle and the bridle were tight. He felt his arms and legs were tired. He wanted to quit. He wanted to go back to Spot. He cried, ""Help! Help!""
The farmer heard Tom. He ran to the horse. He grabbed the reins and stopped the horse. He helped Tom get off the horse. He said, ""Tom, are you okay? You should not have ridden that horse. He is too wild for you. You could have been hurt. You should have listened to me. You should have stayed with Spot. He is a good horse.""
Tom was sorry. He said, ""I'm sorry, farmer. I'm sorry, Spot. I was wrong. I should have listened to you. I should have stayed with you. You are a good horse. Can I ride you again?""
Spot nuzzled Tom. He forgave Tom. He let Tom ride him again. Tom and Spot went back to the farm. They helped with the cows and the sheep and the pigs. They were happy."
"Sara and Ben wanted to paint a rainbow. They had red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple paints. They took a big paper and a brush each. They started to paint from one side of the paper.
""Look, I made red and orange!"" Sara said.
""I made yellow and green!"" Ben said.
They moved their brushes to the middle of the paper. But then they saw a problem. They both wanted to paint blue and purple.
""No, I want to paint blue and purple!"" Sara said.
""No, I want to paint blue and purple!"" Ben said.
They both pushed their brushes to the same spot. The paints mixed and made a brown mess.
""Oh no, we ruined the rainbow!"" Sara said.
""We can't complete it now!"" Ben said.
They felt sad and angry. They put down their brushes and crossed their arms.
Just then, their mom came in. She saw the paper and the paints. She smiled and said, ""What a beautiful rainbow! You two are so lucky to have each other. You can share and make anything together.""
Sara and Ben looked at their mom. They looked at the paper. They saw that the brown mess was not so bad. It looked like a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
They smiled and said, ""Thank you, mom. You are right. We are lucky to have each other. We can share and make anything together.""
They hugged their mom and each other. They picked up their brushes and completed the rainbow. They were happy."
"Jen and Ben had a dog named Spot. Spot was unique. He had black and white spots all over his fur. He liked to run and play and chase balls. Jen and Ben loved Spot very much.
One day, Jen and Ben wanted to take Spot to the park. They had a new leash for him. It was red and shiny and had a bell on it. Jen and Ben thought it was very pretty. They hoped Spot would like it too.
They put the leash on Spot and went outside. Spot was excited. He saw a lot of things to sniff and explore. He pulled on the leash and made the bell ring. Jen and Ben laughed and followed him.
But when they got to the park, they saw a problem. There was a big sign that said: ""No dogs allowed"". Jen and Ben were sad. They wanted to play with Spot in the park. They looked around and saw a lot of people and children and bikes and swings. They did not see any other dogs.
They wondered what to do. They did not want to break the rule. They did not want to make Spot unhappy. They did not want to go back home. They wished they could find a place where Spot could fit in.
Then they saw it. Across the street, there was a pet store. It had a big window with a lot of animals inside. There were cats and birds and fish and hamsters and rabbits. And there were also dogs. They were all different sizes and colors and shapes. They looked happy and friendly.
Jen and Ben had an idea. They asked their mom if they could go to the pet store. Their mom said yes. They crossed the street and went inside. They took Spot with them. They showed him the other animals. They let him sniff and greet and play with the other dogs. They saw that Spot was unique, but he was not alone. He fit in with the other dogs. He made new friends.
Jen and Ben were happy. They found a place where Spot could fit in. They also liked the other animals. They asked their mom if they could come back again. Their mom said yes. They thanked the pet store owner and left. They still had the red and shiny leash with the bell on it. They still thought it was very pretty. They still hoped Spot would like it too. They decided to keep it for another day. A day when they could find a park where dogs were allowed. A park where Spot could run and play and chase balls. A park where Spot could be unique and happy."
"Lily and Tom are friends. They like to play and sing. They have a little house in the garden. They go there every day.
One day, they see a big dog. The dog is not nice. The dog is angry. The dog runs to the little house. Lily and Tom are scared. They try to hide.
The dog finds them. The dog barks and bites. Lily and Tom cry and scream. They want help. But no one hears them.
The dog hurts them a lot. Lily and Tom stop crying and screaming. They stop playing and singing. They are very sad. The dog is very bad. The end."
"Lila and Tom are friends. They like to play with dolls and cars. One day, Lila has a new doll. She is very happy. She shows Tom her new doll. It has a blue dress and yellow hair.
""Wow, your new doll is very pretty!"" Tom says.
""Thank you, Tom. Do you want to play with her?"" Lila asks.
""Yes, please. Can I hold her?"" Tom says.
Lila gives Tom her new doll. Tom holds her gently. He looks at her dress. He sees a thread. He pulls the thread.
""Tom, what are you doing?"" Lila says.
""I want to see what is inside the dress,"" Tom says.
He pulls the thread harder. The dress rips. The stuffing comes out. Lila sees her new doll with no dress and no stuffing. She is very sad. She cries.
""Tom, you broke my new doll! You are a bad friend!"" Lila says.
""I'm sorry, Lila. I didn't mean to break your new doll. I was just curious. Please don't cry,"" Tom says.
But Lila does not listen. She takes her new doll and runs away. She does not want to play with Tom anymore. Tom is very sorry. He wishes he did not peek at the thread. He wishes he could fix the new doll. He wishes he could make Lila happy again. But he can't. He is alone. He is sad. The end."
"Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play with their toys and books. But sometimes they fight. Lily wants to play with the doll and Ben wants to play with the car. They yell and pull and cry.
Mom comes and says, ""Stop fighting! You need to share and be nice. Use your brain and think of a way to play together. Or I will shut the door and you will stay in your room.""
Lily and Ben do not want to stay in their room. They want to play. They look at their toys and books. They see a large box. They have an idea.
They put the doll and the car in the box. They make the box a house. They pretend the doll and the car are a family. They take turns to be the mom and the dad. They have fun.
Mom comes and sees them playing. She smiles and says, ""Good job! You used your brain and found a way to play together. You are smart and kind. I am proud of you."" She gives them a hug and a kiss. Lily and Ben are happy."
"Ben and Lily were twins who liked to play with their toys. One day, they found a big box in the garage. It was heavy and had a label that said ""Do not open"". Ben and Lily were curious and wanted to see what was inside.
They pushed and pulled the box until they moved it to the living room. They used a scissors to cut the tape and opened the box. Inside, they saw a lot of shiny things that looked like stars. They were happy and started to take them out and play with them.
But the shiny things were not stars. They were fireworks that their dad had bought for a special night. The scissors made a spark when they cut the tape, and the spark lit one of the fireworks. The firework made a loud noise and flew out of the box. It hit the curtains and set them on fire.
Ben and Lily were scared and ran away. They heard more noises and saw more fire. They hid under the bed and cried. Their mom and dad came home and saw the smoke and the flames. They called the firemen and tried to put out the fire.
The firemen came and stopped the fire. They asked Ben and Lily what happened. Ben and Lily felt guilty and told them the truth. They said they were sorry and that they did not know the shiny things were dangerous. Their mom and dad were angry and sad. They gave Ben and Lily a big hug and said they were glad they were safe. But they also said they had to pay a lot of money to fix the house and the things that were burned. They said Ben and Lily had to give away some of their toys and do extra chores to help. Ben and Lily nodded and said they would. They wished they had never opened the box."
"Anna liked to look at tiny things with her microscope. She had a book with pictures of bugs and flowers and other things that were too small to see. She would put a slide under the microscope and turn the knob to make it bigger and clearer.
One day, her brother Tom came into her room and saw her microscope. He wanted to play with it too. He grabbed the book and the slides and said, ""I want to look at these. You can't have them. They are mine now.""
Anna was angry. She said, ""No, they are not. They are mine. You are being bossy and mean. Give them back to me.""
Tom said, ""No, I won't. I am older and smarter than you. I can do what I want. You can't tell me what to do.""
They started to fight and pull and push each other. They knocked over the microscope and it fell on the floor. It broke into pieces and made a loud noise.
Their mom heard the noise and came into the room. She saw the broken microscope and the mess. She was very upset. She said, ""What did you do? How could you be so careless and rude? You have to share and be nice to each other. You are both in trouble now."""
"Anna and Ben are friends. They like to play and laugh together. One day, they find a book of jokes. They want to read the jokes and make each other laugh.
Anna reads the first joke. She says, ""What do you call a fish that wears a bow tie?"" Ben thinks hard. He does not know. Anna says, ""Sofishticated!"" She laughs. Ben laughs too. He thinks the joke is funny.
Ben reads the next joke. He says, ""Why did the chicken cross the road?"" Anna thinks hard. She does not know. Ben says, ""To get to the other slide!"" He laughs. Anna does not laugh. She is confused. She says, ""That is not a joke. That is silly. Chickens do not slide.""
Ben says, ""Yes, they do. Look at the picture."" He shows Anna the picture in the book. It is a chicken on a slide. Anna says, ""That is not a real chicken. That is a drawing. Drawings are not real.""
Ben says, ""But it is a joke. Jokes are not real. Jokes are funny."" Anna says, ""No, jokes are real. Jokes make sense. That joke does not make sense. That joke is bad.""
Anna and Ben start to argue. They do not agree on what is a joke. They do not laugh anymore. They get angry and sad. They cry.
Mom hears them cry. She comes to see what is wrong. She sees the book of jokes. She says, ""What is the matter, Anna and Ben? Why are you crying?""
Anna and Ben tell Mom about the jokes. They tell her why they are confused and upset. Mom listens. She says, ""I understand. Jokes are tricky. Sometimes they are funny. Sometimes they are not. Sometimes they make sense. Sometimes they do not. It is okay to have different opinions. It is okay to not like a joke. But it is not okay to fight and cry. You are friends. You should be kind and respectful to each other. You should share and take turns. You should say sorry and forgive. You should have fun and learn together.""
Anna and Ben nod. They say sorry to each other. They hug and make up. They wipe their tears. They smile. They decide to read more jokes. They hope to find some that they both like. They thank Mom for helping them. Mom says, ""You are welcome. I love you both. Jokes are good. Jokes make you laugh. Laughter is good. Laughter makes you happy."""
"Sara liked to look at the owl in the big tree. The owl had big eyes and soft feathers. Sara thought the owl was attractive. She wanted to be friends with the owl.
One day, Sara brought some nuts and seeds to the tree. She hoped the owl would like them. She called to the owl, ""Hello, owl! Do you want to play with me? I have some food for you!""
The owl looked at Sara and blinked. He did not want to play with Sara. He wanted to sleep. He was tired from hunting at night. He said to Sara, ""Hoo, hoo, go away! I do not want to play. I do not want your food. Leave me alone!""
Sara felt sad and angry. She did not like the owl's words. She said to the owl, ""You are mean and rude! You do not know how to be nice. I quit! I do not want to be your friend anymore!""
She threw the nuts and seeds on the ground and ran away. She did not look at the owl again. The owl did not care. He closed his eyes and went back to sleep. He did not need Sara's friendship. He was happy by himself."
"Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play in the snow. They make a snowman and a snow fort. They throw snowballs at each other. They laugh and have fun.
But soon they feel cold and hungry. They want to go inside and have some hot chocolate. They put on their hats and gloves and scarves. They say goodbye to their snowman and their snow fort. They march to the door of their house.
Mama is waiting for them. She has a big smile and a warm hug. She has two cups of hot chocolate on the table. She puts some marshmallows on top. She says, ""Here you go, my sweeties. Drink this and you will feel warm and cozy.""
Lily and Ben sit down and sip their hot chocolate. They feel the heat in their mouths and their bellies. They say, ""Thank you, Mama. This is yummy."" They look out the window and see their snowman and their snow fort. They are icy and white. They say, ""We will play with you again tomorrow."""
"Tim and Mia were playing with their dolls in the living room. They had a lot of toys and clothes for their dolls, because their mom and dad always gave them what they wanted. They were spoiled children.
""Look at my doll, she has a new dress with a zipper!"" Mia said, showing off her doll to Tim. ""She can zip and unzip it like this, see?""
Tim was not impressed. He wanted a zipper for his doll too. He looked around and saw a jacket on the couch. It had a zipper too. He had an idea.
""I have a zipper too!"" he said, grabbing the jacket and running to his doll. He tried to put the jacket on his doll, but it was too big. He pulled the zipper hard, but it got stuck. He pulled harder, but it broke. He heard a loud rip.
""Hey, that's my jacket!"" Mia shouted, seeing what Tim had done. ""You broke it! You broke my zipper!""
She ran to Tim and tried to take the jacket from him. They both pulled and pushed, and the jacket tore more. They started to cry.
Their mom heard the noise and came to the living room. She saw the mess and the broken jacket. She was angry.
""What have you done?"" she asked them. ""You ruined Mia's jacket! That was a gift from grandma! How could you be so careless?""
She took the jacket from them and threw it in the trash. She looked at their dolls and their toys. She shook her head.
""You have too many things, and you don't appreciate them. You need to learn to share and to take care of your stuff. From now on, I will supply you with only one toy each, and you will have to play with it nicely. Do you understand?""
Tim and Mia nodded, feeling sorry and ashamed. They hugged each other and said they were sorry. They hoped their mom would forgive them and give them back their toys someday. They learned their lesson."
"Tim and Mia were playing in the park. They liked to dig in the sand and look for treasures. One day, they found something shiny and hard in the sand. It was gold!
""Wow, look at this!"" Tim said, holding the gold in his hand. ""It is so pretty and bright!""
""Let me see!"" Mia said, reaching for the gold. ""Maybe we can buy candy with it!""
They were so happy with their find. They did not see the enormous shadow that fell over them. It was a big, scary dog. It had sharp teeth and a loud bark. It wanted the gold too.
The dog ran towards them, growling and snarling. Tim and Mia were very afraid. They dropped the gold and ran away. They trembled as they hid behind a slide.
""Go away, bad dog!"" Tim shouted. ""That is our gold!""
But the dog did not listen. It picked up the gold in its mouth and ran away. Tim and Mia were sad and angry. They had lost their treasure.
""Maybe we can find more gold another day,"" Mia said, trying to cheer up Tim.
""Or maybe we can find something else,"" Tim said, wiping his tears. ""Like a rainbow or a star.""
They hugged each other and went home. They still liked to play in the park, but they always looked out for the big, scary dog."
"Lily and Max were playing in the park. They liked the slide a lot. They took turns to go down the slide. Lily went first, then Max, then Lily, then Max.
But then a big boy came. He said he wanted the slide. He pushed Lily and Max away. He said they were too small and he was big. He said the slide was his.
Lily and Max were sad and scared. They did not know what to do. They looked at their mom. Their mom was on a bench. She was reading a book. She did not see the big boy.
Lily wanted to tell their mom. She said to Max, ""Let's go to mom. She will help us."" But Max was obedient. He said, ""No, mom said we have to play nice and share. We have to wait for our turn.""
Lily did not like that. She said, ""But he is not nice. He is mean. He does not share. He took our slide."" Max shrugged. He said, ""I don't know. Maybe he will go soon. Maybe he will get bored.""
Lily and Max waited and waited. But the big boy did not go. He did not get bored. He kept going down the slide. He laughed and shouted. He did not care about Lily and Max.
Lily and Max were very sad. They missed the slide. They wished the big boy would leave. They wished their mom would see. They wished they could have fun."
"Sam and Mia liked to travel with their mom and dad. They went to many places and saw many things. One day, they went to a farm where they could play with animals and make things with clay.
Sam and Mia saw a big pile of clay and ran to it. They wanted to make animals with clay. Sam made a cow and Mia made a sheep. They were very happy with their clay animals.
But then, they saw a little pig who was sad. The pig had no friends and no clay. He wanted to play with Sam and Mia, but he was shy. He looked at their clay animals and wished he had one too.
Sam and Mia saw the pig and felt sorry for him. They were compassionate and wanted to help him. They decided to share their clay with the pig and make him a friend.
""Hi, little pig,"" Sam said. ""Do you want to play with us? We have some clay for you. You can make an animal too.""
""Really?"" the pig said. ""Thank you, Sam and Mia. You are very kind. I would like to make a pig with clay.""
Sam and Mia gave some clay to the pig and helped him make a pig. The pig was very happy and proud of his clay pig. He hugged Sam and Mia and thanked them again.
Sam and Mia were happy too. They learned that sharing is caring and that making friends is fun. They played with the pig and their clay animals until it was time to go home. They said goodbye to the pig and promised to come back soon. The pig waved to them and smiled. He was not sad anymore. He had friends and clay."
"Tom had a huge toy car that he loved to play with. It was red and shiny and made loud noises. He liked to drive it around the yard and pretend he was a racer. But he had a problem. His toy car was too big to fit in the garage. The garage was where he kept his other toys, like his bike and his ball and his teddy bear.
One day, Tom had an idea. He saw his dad's car parked in the driveway. His dad's car was also red and shiny and made loud noises. Maybe his dad's car could fit in the garage, and then he could put his toy car in the driveway. Tom thought that was a good plan. He ran to his dad's car and opened the door. He climbed inside and tried to find the keys. He did not know how to drive a real car, but he thought it was easy. He just had to turn the wheel and push the pedals.
Tom found the keys and put them in the hole. He turned them and the car started. He was very happy. He pushed the pedal and the car moved. He turned the wheel and the car turned. He did not see the fence or the tree or the mailbox. He only saw the garage. He wanted to fit his dad's car in the garage. He pushed the pedal harder and the car went faster. He turned the wheel more and the car went straight to the garage.
But the car did not fit in the garage. The car was too big and the garage was too small. The car crashed into the garage and made a huge noise. The garage broke and fell down. The car broke and stopped. Tom was scared and sad. He did not know what he did. He did not know what his dad would say. He did not know what to do. He started to cry. He wished he never touched his dad's car. He wished he played with his toy car instead. He wished he could fit his toy car in the garage. But he could not. He made a big mess. He made a big mistake. He made a bad ending."
"Lila and Ben are friends. They like to play in the park. They run, jump, slide and swing. They have fun.
One day, they see a big truck in the park. The truck is noisy. It makes loud sounds. Vroom, vroom, beep, beep. Lila and Ben are curious. They want to see the truck.
They go near the truck. They see a man. The man is holding a palm. The palm is green and tall. The man is putting the palm in the truck.
""Hello, man,"" Lila says. ""What are you doing with the palm?""
""Hello, kids,"" the man says. ""I am taking the palm to a new place. The palm is too big for the park. It needs more space.""
""Can we go with you?"" Ben asks. ""We want to see the new place.""
""Sorry, kids,"" the man says. ""You cannot go with me. The truck is full. And the new place is far. You have to stay in the park. But you can wave goodbye to the palm.""
Lila and Ben are sad. They like the palm. They hug the palm. They say goodbye to the palm. They wave to the man and the truck. The truck leaves the park. The truck is noisy. Vroom, vroom, beep, beep.
Lila and Ben look at the empty spot. The spot is where the palm was. The spot is now small and brown. Lila and Ben are sad.
""Let's play,"" Lila says. ""Maybe we can find a new friend in the park.""
""OK,"" Ben says. ""Let's play.""
They run, jump, slide and swing. They have fun. They end the day with a smile."
"One day, a prince was playing in the garden with his ball. He saw a big bird in the sky. The bird was hungry and wanted to eat the ball. The prince was scared and ran to his mother.
""Mommy, mommy, help me! The bird wants to take my ball!"" he cried.
His mother hugged him and said, ""Don't worry, my dear. I will protect you and your ball. The bird can't hurt you.""
She took a stick and waved it at the bird. The bird was afraid and flew away. The prince was happy and thanked his mother.
""Thank you, mommy. You are brave and kind. I love you,"" he said.
His mother smiled and said, ""I love you too, my prince. You are my precious son. Now, let's go inside and have some cookies.""
They went inside and ate some cookies. The prince shared his cookies with his mother. He was sorry for the bird. He hoped the bird would find some food somewhere else. He wished the bird would be his friend. He said a little prayer for the bird. He was a good prince."
"Lily and Ben were playing in the garden. They had a big blanket and some toys. They wanted to have a picnic under the sun.
""Let's spread the blanket here, Ben,"" Lily said. She put the blanket on the grass and smoothed it with her hands.
""OK, Lily,"" Ben said. He opened the toy chest and took out some plates, cups and food. He put them on the blanket. ""Look, we have sandwiches, juice and cookies. Yum!""
They sat on the blanket and ate their picnic. They talked and laughed and shared their food. They felt happy and warm in their chests.
""This is a lovely day, Lily,"" Ben said. He smiled at his sister.
""Yes, it is, Ben,"" Lily said. She hugged him. ""You are a lovely brother.""
They finished their picnic and packed their toys. They folded the blanket and put it in the chest. They held hands and went back to the house. They had a lovely time in the garden."
"Lily and Ben are twins. They like to play with animals. One day, they go to the zoo with Mom and Dad. They see many animals, like lions, monkeys, and elephants. They are very happy.
They come to a big cage with birds. The birds have many colors, like red, blue, and yellow. Lily and Ben want to see them closer. They rush to the cage and put their faces on the bars. They say hello to the birds.
But one bird is not happy. It is pale and sad. It does not sing or fly. It sits on a branch and looks at Lily and Ben. Lily and Ben see the bird and feel sorry for it. They ask Mom and Dad why the bird is pale and sad.
Mom and Dad say the bird is sick. It needs a doctor and medicine. They say the zoo people are trying to help the bird. They say Lily and Ben can pray for the bird to get better.
Lily and Ben nod. They say bye to the bird and tell it to be strong. They hope the bird will get better soon. They go to see other animals, but they do not forget the pale and sad bird. They pray for it in their hearts."
"Sam was a curious boy who liked to examine everything he saw. One day, he found a big onion in the kitchen. He wondered what it was and how it smelled. He picked up the onion and peeled off the brown skin. He saw many white layers inside.
He wanted to know more, so he brought the onion to his nose and sniffed it. It smelled very strong and made his eyes water. He sneezed and rubbed his eyes. He felt a burning pain in his eyes and nose. He dropped the onion and cried.
His mom heard him and ran to the kitchen. She saw him holding his face and the onion on the floor. She knew what happened and felt sorry for him. She hugged him and took him to the sink. She washed his eyes and nose with water. She told him the onion was a food that made people cry. She said he should not examine it with his nose. She gave him a cookie and a kiss.
Sam learned his lesson and never examined an onion again. He still liked to be curious, but he was more careful. He asked his mom before he touched anything new. He did not want to cry or hurt himself again. He was a smart boy."
"Sara and Ben love to play in the garden. They like to dig, water, and plant seeds. They also like to look for bugs and birds. Sometimes they pretend to be animals or fairies.
One day, they find a big, shiny stone in the garden. It is round and smooth and has many colors. Sara picks it up and says, ""Look, Ben, what a pretty stone! Maybe it is magic!""
Ben takes the stone and says, ""Maybe it can make us become anything we want! Let's try it!""
They close their eyes and wish very hard. Sara wishes to become a butterfly, and Ben wishes to become a lion. They open their eyes and look at each other.
But nothing has changed. They are still Sara and Ben, holding the stone. They feel sad and confused.
""Maybe the stone is broken,"" Sara says.
""Or maybe we need to say a magic word,"" Ben says.
They try different words, like ""abracadabra"", ""please"", and ""banana"". But nothing works.
They are about to give up, when they hear a voice.
""Hello, children. What are you doing with my stone?""
They turn around and see a lady with a big hat and a basket. She is smiling and has a mild voice.
She is the gardener. She tells them that the stone is not magic, but a special kind of rock that she found in the mountains. She says that she likes to keep it in the garden, because it makes her happy.
She also tells them that they don't need a stone to become anything they want. They can use their imagination and their creativity. She says that she likes to pretend to be a bird or a flower sometimes.
She invites them to join her in the garden, and shows them how to make crowns and necklaces with leaves and flowers. She also teaches them the names of the plants and the animals.
Sara and Ben forget about the stone. They have fun with the gardener, and learn many new things. They decide that the garden is a magical place, after all."
"Sam and Mia are friends. They like to play together. Sometimes they play with toys, sometimes they play with balls, sometimes they run and jump.
One day, they decide to play exercise. They want to be strong and healthy. They find a big rope in the yard. They think it is fun to pull the rope.
Sam says, ""I will pull this end, and you pull that end. We will see who is stronger.""
Mia says, ""OK, let's do it. But be careful, don't pull too hard.""
They start to pull the rope. They pull and pull and pull. They feel their arms and legs working. They laugh and smile.
But then, something happens. The rope breaks. It snaps in the middle. Sam and Mia fall down. They are surprised and scared.
They look at the rope. It is old and thin. It is not reliable. It is not good for exercise.
Sam says, ""Oh no, the rope is broken. It is not a good rope. It is a bad rope.""
Mia says, ""Yes, it is a bad rope. But we are OK. We are not hurt. We are still friends.""
They hug each other. They are happy. They decide to find another game to play. They look for a reliable toy. They find a ball. They think it is fun to kick the ball. They play exercise with the ball. They are strong and healthy."
"Anna and Ben were playing in the garden. They found a big hole in the ground. They wanted to see what was inside.
""Let's fill the hole with water and make a pond!"" said Anna.
""No, let's fill the hole with sand and make a castle!"" said Ben.
They started to argue. They did not want to share the hole.
Suddenly, they saw something shiny in the hole. They stopped arguing and looked closer. It was a tooth!
""Wow, a tooth! Whose tooth is it?"" asked Anna.
""Maybe it is a dinosaur tooth!"" said Ben.
""Maybe it is a fairy tooth!"" said Anna.
They picked up the tooth and examined it. It was big and white and had a mysterious mark on it.
They heard a loud roar behind them. They turned around and saw a lion. The lion was angry. He had a gap in his mouth where the tooth was missing.
""Give me back my tooth!"" he roared.
Anna and Ben were scared. They dropped the tooth and ran away. They hid behind a tree.
They realized they had been silly. They should not have fought over the hole. They should have respected the lion's tooth.
They learned a lesson. They decided to be kind and share with each other. They also decided to leave the hole alone. It was not theirs to fill."
"Lily and Tom were playing in the park with their toys. They liked to share and have fun. Lily had a rare doll that her grandma gave her. It had a pretty dress and long hair. Tom had a big truck that made noises and moved.
""Can I play with your doll?"" Tom asked Lily.
""OK, but be careful. She is very rare and special,"" Lily said.
Lily gave Tom her doll and took his truck. She drove it around the grass and made honking sounds. Tom looked at the doll and smiled. He liked her hair. He pulled it hard.
""Ow!"" the doll said. She had a voice box inside her. ""That hurts!""
Lily heard the doll and ran to Tom. She saw him tear her hair.
""Stop! You are hurting her!"" Lily cried. She grabbed the doll from Tom. She saw a big hole in her hair. She felt sad and angry.
""I'm sorry, Lily. I didn't mean to,"" Tom said. He looked sorry too.
Lily hugged her doll and tried to fix her hair. She did not want to play with Tom anymore. She wanted to go home and keep her doll safe.
""Let's go, Mommy,"" Lily said. She walked to her mommy, who was sitting on a bench.
""What's wrong, sweetie?"" Mommy asked. She saw Lily's doll and the hole in her hair.
""Tom tore her hair. He was mean,"" Lily said.
Mommy looked at Tom and his mommy. They came over and said sorry.
""We're sorry, Lily. Tom didn't know how to play with your doll. He likes trucks better,"" Tom's mommy said.
""Can you forgive him, Lily?"" Mommy asked.
Lily thought for a moment. She was still sad, but she remembered that Tom was her friend. He made her laugh sometimes. He shared his truck with her.
""OK, I forgive you, Tom. But don't do it again,"" Lily said.
""Thank you, Lily. I won't do it again. I'm sorry,"" Tom said.
Lily and Tom hugged and said sorry. They decided to play with their own toys. They were still friends. Mommy and Tom's mommy smiled and said they were proud of them. Lily's doll was rare, but so was her friendship."
"Lily and Ben were playing in the park. They liked to hop on the grass and look for bugs. They saw a big frog near the pond. It was green and wet.
""Look, a frog!"" Lily said. ""Can we catch it?""
Ben nodded. He ran to the frog and tried to grab it. But the frog was fast. It hopped away from Ben and into the water.
""Come back, frog!"" Ben shouted. He was angry. He wanted to play with the frog.
Lily followed Ben to the pond. She saw the frog under the water. It looked at them with big eyes.
""Maybe the frog is scared,"" Lily said. ""Maybe it does not like to be caught.""
Ben frowned. He did not understand. He liked to catch things.
""Let's try again,"" he said. He reached for the frog.
But the frog did not want to be caught. It hopped out of the water and onto the shore. It made a loud croak. It sounded angry.
""Go away, kids!"" the frog said. ""This is my home. Leave me alone!""
Lily and Ben were surprised. They did not know that frogs could talk. They felt sorry for the frog.
""Sorry, frog,"" Lily said. ""We did not mean to bother you. We just wanted to be your friends.""
The frog looked at them. It saw that they were not bad. It felt a little less angry.
""Friends?"" the frog said. ""Well, maybe. But you have to be nice. And you have to hop with me. Do you like to hop?""
Lily and Ben smiled. They liked to hop. They nodded.
""OK, frog,"" Ben said. ""We will hop with you. And we will be nice.""
The frog smiled too. It hopped with Lily and Ben on the grass. They had fun. They became friends. They forgot about the dark."
"Lily and Ben were friends who liked to play with toys. They had a toy phone that could record their voices. They liked to pretend they were talking to each other or to other people.
One day, they decided to play a prank on Lily's big sister, Mia. They hid the toy phone under Mia's bed and recorded a scary message. They said, ""Hello, Mia. We are the monsters under your bed. We are going to get you when you sleep. Boo!""
They giggled and ran away, leaving the toy phone on. They waited for Mia to come home and hear the message. They thought it would be very funny.
But Mia did not come home that day. She had to stay at the hospital because she was sick. Lily and Ben did not know that. They got bored and went to play with other toys.
That night, Lily's mom came to her room and told her the bad news. Mia had a fever and had to stay at the hospital for a long time. Lily felt very sad and scared. She wanted to see her sister and hug her.
She went to her bed and tried to sleep. But then she heard a voice under her bed. It was the toy phone. It said, ""Hello, Mia. We are the monsters under your bed. We are going to get you when you sleep. Boo!""
Lily screamed and cried. She thought the monsters were real and they had come for her. She did not remember that it was her and Ben who recorded the message. She called for her mom, but her mom did not hear her. She was too busy talking to the doctor on the phone.
Lily felt very alone and afraid. She wished she had not played the prank on Mia. She wished she had been a humble and kind sister. She wished Mia was there to protect her. But she was not. She had left her alone with the monsters."
"Lily was a new girl at the big school. She was scared and shy. She did not know anyone. She did not want to leave her mom.
But mom said, ""Don't worry, Lily. The staff here are very nice. They will help you and teach you. They will welcome you and be your friends.""
Lily walked with mom to the door. A lady with a big smile and a fat cat came to meet them. She said, ""Hello, I am Miss Rose. I am the teacher of the little class. And this is Fluffy, my cat. He likes to play and cuddle. We are happy to see you, Lily. Welcome to the big school.""
Lily looked at Miss Rose and Fluffy. They seemed kind and friendly. She smiled a little and said, ""Hello, Miss Rose. Hello, Fluffy. I like cats too. Can I pet him?""
Miss Rose nodded and said, ""Of course, you can. Fluffy loves to be petted. Come, let me show you the classroom. There are many toys and books and colors. You will have fun and learn a lot. And you will make new friends too.""
Lily took Miss Rose's hand and followed her to the classroom. She saw other kids playing and talking. Some of them waved and said, ""Hi, Lily. Come and join us."" Lily felt less scared and shy. She said, ""Hi, everyone. I am Lily. I am new here."" She let go of Miss Rose's hand and went to play with the other kids. She was glad she came to the big school. She thought, ""Maybe this will be a good place for me."""
"Ben and Sam were best friends. They liked to play outside and go on adventures. One day, they saw a kayak by the lake. It was red and shiny and looked like fun.
""Wow, look at that kayak!"" Ben said. ""Can we try it?""
""I don't know,"" Sam said. ""It's not ours. Maybe someone left it here.""
""Or maybe they don't want it anymore,"" Ben said. ""Let's go and see.""
They ran to the kayak and touched it. It was smooth and hard. They looked inside and saw two paddles.
""Let's go for a ride,"" Ben said. ""It will be fun.""
""But what if someone comes back and gets angry?"" Sam said. ""We should ask first.""
""Who are we going to ask?"" Ben said. ""There's no one here. Come on, don't be scared.""
Ben climbed into the kayak and grabbed a paddle. He waited for Sam to join him.
Sam looked around. He felt bad. He knew it was wrong to take something that was not theirs. He wanted to have fun, but he also wanted to be good.
""Ben, I don't think we should do this,"" Sam said. ""It's not nice. Let's go and play something else.""
Ben frowned. He was annoyed. He wanted to go on the kayak. He thought Sam was being silly.
""Fine, be a baby,"" Ben said. ""I'm going without you.""
He pushed the kayak into the water and started to paddle. He felt happy and free. He didn't care about Sam.
Sam watched Ben go. He felt sad and lonely. He wished Ben would listen to him. He hoped Ben would be safe.
Soon, Ben was far away from the shore. He looked around and saw the lake was big and beautiful. He saw fish and birds and trees. He smiled and paddled faster.
But then, he heard a loud voice.
""Hey, you! Get out of my kayak!""
Ben turned and saw a man on the shore. He was big and angry. He was waving his arms and shouting.
Ben felt scared. He realized he had made a mistake. He had taken someone else's kayak. He had been bad.
He tried to paddle back, but it was hard. The wind was blowing and the water was choppy. He felt tired and sorry.
The man ran into the water and swam towards Ben. He reached the kayak and grabbed it. He pulled Ben out and dragged him to the shore.
He was very mad. He yelled at Ben and asked him why he had taken his kayak. He said he had been generous and let other people use his kayak, but only if they asked first. He said Ben had been rude and selfish.
Ben felt ashamed. He didn't know what to say. He wished he had listened to Sam. He wished he had been good.
He looked at Sam, who was still on the shore. Sam looked at him with pity and concern. He walked over to Ben and the man.
He said he was sorry for what Ben had done. He said they were friends and they had seen the kayak and wanted to try it. He said Ben had not listened to him and had gone without asking. He said he had tried to stop him and had stayed behind.
He said they had learned their lesson and they would never do it again. He said they were sorry and they hoped the man would forgive them.
The man looked at Sam and Ben. He saw they were young and scared. He saw they had made a mistake and they were sorry. He felt his anger fade.
He said he was glad Sam had been honest and brave. He said he was glad Ben had come back and had apologized. He said he would forgive them, but only if they promised to be good and to respect other people's things.
He said he would be generous and let them use his kayak, but only if they asked first and followed his rules. He said he would teach them how to paddle and how to be safe on the water.
He said he hoped they would enjoy the kayak and the lake, but also learn to be good and kind.
Sam and Ben nodded. They said they were sorry and they thanked the man. They said they would be good and they would respect his kayak. They said they would like to learn from him and have fun with him.
They hugged each other and smiled. They felt happy and relieved. They had made a new friend and they had learned a valuable lesson.
They had learned to be good and generous."
"Tom and Lily were twins who liked to look at the stars at night. They had a big book with pictures of stars, planets and comets. They learned that comets were balls of ice and dust that flew very fast in the sky. Sometimes they could see a comet with a long tail of light.
One night, their dad said, ""There is a special comet in the sky tonight. It is very bright and beautiful. Do you want to see it?""
Tom and Lily nodded and ran to get their coats and hats. They followed their dad to the backyard, where he had set up a telescope. He helped them take turns to look through the lens.
""Wow!"" Tom said. ""The comet is so big and shiny! It looks like a star with a long hair!""
""It's amazing!"" Lily said. ""The comet is so pretty! It looks like a fairy with a magic wand!""
Their dad smiled and said, ""You both have good imaginations. The comet is called Halley's Comet. It only comes once every 76 years. That means you won't see it again until you are very old.""
Tom and Lily gasped. They felt lucky to see the comet. They wanted to remember it forever.
""Can we draw the comet, dad?"" Tom asked.
""Can we write a story about the comet, dad?"" Lily asked.
Their dad nodded and said, ""Sure, you can. But first, you have to choose. Do you want to draw or write?""
Tom and Lily looked at each other. They both liked to draw and write. They both wanted to do both. But they knew they had to choose.
Tom thought for a moment and said, ""I want to draw the comet. I like to use colors and shapes.""
Lily thought for a moment and said, ""I want to write the story about the comet. I like to use words and sentences.""
Their dad said, ""That's a good choice. You can both express yourselves in different ways. Let's go inside and get some paper and pencils.""
Tom and Lily followed their dad to the house. They were excited to create their comet art. They did not mind that their room was messy. They only cared about the comet."
"Lily and Ben were best friends. They liked to play in the park every day. They liked to swing, slide and run. They also liked to talk to the birds and the squirrels.
One day, they saw a big, black dog in the park. The dog looked playful. He wagged his tail and ran towards them. Lily and Ben were not afraid. They liked dogs.
""Hello, doggy!"" Lily said. ""What is your name?""
The dog did not reply. He jumped on Lily and licked her face. Lily giggled.
""Stop, doggy!"" Ben said. ""You are too rough!""
The dog did not reply. He jumped on Ben and licked his face. Ben laughed.
""Let's play, doggy!"" Lily said. ""You can be our friend!""
The dog did not reply. He ran away with Lily's shoe in his mouth. Lily and Ben chased him.
""Come back, doggy!"" Ben said. ""That is Lily's shoe!""
The dog did not reply. He dropped the shoe and ran to a man. The man was the dog's owner. He was looking for him.
""Sorry, kids!"" the man said. ""This is Rex. He is very playful, but he does not listen well. He likes to take things that are not his.""
Lily and Ben got the shoe back. They were not angry. They liked Rex.
""It's okay, mister!"" Lily said. ""Rex is fun. Can we play with him again?""
The man smiled. He replied, ""Sure, kids. You can play with Rex anytime. He likes you too.""
Lily and Ben were happy. They had a new friend. They played with Rex until it was time to go home. They waved goodbye to Rex and the man. They hoped to see them again."
"Tim and Mia are twins. They like to play with their toys and pretend they are in space. They have a big box that they call their rocket. They put stickers on it and draw stars and planets.
One day, they decide to go on a mission to explore the universe. They put on their helmets and suits and get inside the box. They count down from ten and then make loud noises like a rocket.
""Zoom! Zoom! We are flying to the moon!"" Tim says.
""Look! There is a big cheese ball!"" Mia says. She points to a yellow ball on the floor.
""Can we eat it?"" Tim asks.
Mia nods. They get out of the box and run to the ball. They pick it up and take a bite.
""Mmm, this is yummy!"" Mia says.
She chews the cheese and smiles.
""Wait, this is not cheese!"" Tim says.
He spits out the cheese and makes a face.
""This is rubber! It is hard and yucky!""
He throws the ball away and rubs his tongue.
Mia laughs. She thinks it is funny.
""Sorry, Tim. I was joking. That is not the moon. That is our dog's toy. He likes to chew it.""
She hugs Tim and says sorry.
Tim is not mad. He hugs Mia back and says it is okay.
They go back to their box and pretend they are in space again.
They have fun and forget about the rubber ball.
They are happy twins. They love to play and explore the universe."
"Lily and Ben were very excited. It was almost Christmas and they wanted to decorate their house. They had a big box of shiny things and a green tree in the living room.
""Can I put this star on the top of the tree?"" Lily asked, holding a yellow star.
""Yes, you can. But be careful, the tree is tall. I will help you,"" Ben said, lifting his sister up.
They put the star on the tree and then added more shiny things. They had red balls, silver bells, and colorful lights. The tree looked very pretty.
""Now we need to decorate the chimney,"" Ben said, pointing to the old chimney in the corner. ""Maybe Santa will come and bring us presents.""
""Okay, let's do it,"" Lily said, grabbing a long sock. ""I will hang this sock on the chimney. Maybe Santa will fill it with candy.""
They hung their socks on the chimney and then added some more shiny things. They had paper chains, glittery snowflakes, and a picture of Santa. The chimney looked very festive.
""Wow, we did a good job,"" Ben said, admiring their work.
""Yes, we did. I hope Santa likes it too,"" Lily said, smiling.
They hugged each other and then ran to their mom, who was baking cookies in the kitchen.
""Mom, mom, look what we did!"" they shouted, pulling her to the living room.
Mom looked at the tree and the chimney and smiled.
""You did a wonderful job, my sweeties. You are very creative and thoughtful. I'm sure Santa will love it too,"" she said, kissing them on their cheeks.
They all sat on the couch and ate some cookies, feeling happy and proud. They couldn't wait for Christmas morning."
"Lily and Ben were playing in the snow. They wanted to make an igloo, like the ones they saw in a book. They rolled big balls of snow and piled them up. But the snow was heavy and hard to move.
""I can't do it,"" Lily said. ""It's too hard.""
""Yes, you can,"" Ben said. ""You are strong and smart. I will help you. We can do it together.""
He encouraged her to keep trying. They pushed and lifted the snow balls. They made a hole for the door. They smoothed the walls. They were very proud of their igloo.
""Look, we did it!"" Ben said. ""We made an igloo!""
""It's so cool!"" Lily said. ""Can we go inside?""
They crawled into the igloo. It was cozy and warm. They smiled at each other.
""We are the best igloo makers ever!"" they said."
"Lily and Ben were playing with their bikes in the park. They liked to ride fast and make turns and jumps. Lily was good at balancing on one wheel. She could lift her front wheel or her back wheel and keep going. Ben wanted to learn how to do that too.
""Can you teach me how to balance on one wheel?"" Ben asked Lily.
""Sure, I can teach you. It is fun and easy. You just have to pedal hard and lean a little bit,"" Lily said. She was generous and liked to help her friend.
Lily showed Ben how to balance on one wheel. She lifted her front wheel and rode for a few seconds. Then she lifted her back wheel and rode for a few more seconds. She smiled and waved at Ben.
""Wow, you are so good at balancing on one wheel. Let me try,"" Ben said. He tried to copy Lily, but he was not very good. He lifted his front wheel, but he lost his balance and fell down. He scraped his knee and started to cry.
""Ouch, that hurts. I can't balance on one wheel. It is too hard,"" Ben said.
Lily got off her bike and ran to Ben. She hugged him and said, ""Don't cry, Ben. It is okay. You just need to practice more. You can do it. I will help you. Here, take my band-aid and put it on your knee. It will make you feel better.""
Lily gave Ben her band-aid. She was generous and kind. Ben smiled and said, ""Thank you, Lily. You are a good friend. Can we try again?""
""Of course, we can try again. Come on, let's get back on our bikes and have some fun,"" Lily said.
Lily and Ben got back on their bikes and tried to balance on one wheel. They had some falls and some laughs, but they did not give up. They had fun and learned something new. They were happy and proud."
"Lily and Ben are twins who like to play pretend. They have a toy kitchen and a lot of plastic food. One day, they decide to perform a show for their mom and dad. They want to make a menu with healthy food that their parents will like.
Lily says, ""I will make a salad with lettuce, tomato, and cheese. What will you make, Ben?""
Ben says, ""I will make a pizza with pepperoni, cheese, and sauce. Pizza is yummy!""
Lily says, ""But pizza is not healthy, Ben. It has too much fat and salt. Mom and dad will not like it.""
Ben says, ""Pizza is healthy, Lily. It has cheese and sauce. Cheese and sauce are good for you. Mom and dad will love it.""
Lily and Ben start to argue. They do not agree on what is healthy and what is not. They do not want to share their food or their kitchen. They start to pull and push each other.
Mom and dad hear the noise and come to see what is going on. They see Lily and Ben fighting over the toy kitchen and the plastic food. They are not happy.
Mom says, ""Lily and Ben, what are you doing? Why are you fighting?""
Dad says, ""We thought you were going to perform a show for us. Where is your menu?""
Lily and Ben stop fighting. They feel ashamed. They say, ""We are sorry, mom and dad. We wanted to make a menu with healthy food, but we could not agree on what is healthy. We did not want to share our food or our kitchen.""
Mom says, ""Lily and Ben, it is okay to have different opinions on what is healthy. But it is not okay to fight over it. You have to respect each other and share your toys. You can make a menu with both salad and pizza. That way, you can have some variety and balance.""
Dad says, ""That sounds like a good idea. We would love to see your show and try your food. Can you work together and make a menu with both salad and pizza?""
Lily and Ben nod. They say, ""Yes, mom and dad. We can work together and make a menu with both salad and pizza. We are sorry for fighting. We love you.""
Mom and dad hug Lily and Ben. They say, ""We love you too. We are proud of you for apologizing and cooperating. Now, let's see your show and your menu!"""
"Lily was an adventurous girl who liked to learn new things. She had a tutor who came to her house every week to teach her how to read and write. The tutor was very kind and patient with Lily, and she always brought her fun books and games.
One day, the tutor brought a book about animals that lived in the jungle. Lily was very excited and wanted to see all the pictures. She saw lions, monkeys, elephants, and snakes. She asked the tutor many questions about the animals, and the tutor answered them all.
When they finished the book, the tutor said, ""Lily, you are very smart and curious. You can learn anything you want if you work hard and listen well. I'm very proud of you.""
Lily smiled and hugged the tutor. She said, ""Thank you, tutor. You are the best. I love you.""
The tutor smiled and kissed Lily on the cheek. She said, ""I love you too, Lily. You are a very sweet and adventurous girl.""
Lily learned that day that being adventurous is good, but being kind and grateful is also important. She also learned that kisses are a way to show love and appreciation. She decided to kiss her mom and dad when they came home, and to thank them for giving her a tutor."
"Sara and Ben are twins. They like to play in the backyard. They have a swing, a slide and a sandbox. Sometimes they share, sometimes they fight.
One day, they see a big box in the backyard. It is open. They run to the box and look inside. There are many toys and books and clothes. They are happy and excited.
""Wow, look at all these things!"" Sara says. ""Can we play with them?""
""I don't know,"" Ben says. ""Maybe they are for someone else.""
They hear Mom calling from the house. ""Sara, Ben, come here please. I have something to tell you.""
They leave the box and go to Mom. Mom smiles and hugs them.
""Guess what, my loves?"" Mom says. ""You are going to have a baby brother or sister soon. These are some things for the baby. Do you want to help me sort them out?""
Sara and Ben are surprised and curious. They have many questions.
""Is the baby in your tummy?"" Sara asks.
""Yes, it is,"" Mom says.
""When will the baby come out?"" Ben asks.
""In a few months,"" Mom says.
""Can we play with the baby?"" Sara asks.
""Of course, you can,"" Mom says. ""But you have to be gentle and careful. The baby will be very small and fragile.""
Sara and Ben nod. They want to be good big siblings. They go back to the backyard with Mom and help her manage the things for the baby. They are happy and proud. They can't wait to meet the baby."
"One day, Lily and Ben went to the park with their mom. They saw a big slide, a swing, and a sandbox. They wanted to play with everything.
""Can we go on the slide, mom?"" Lily asked.
""Sure, but be careful. There are some holes in the ground. Don't step on them or you might fall,"" mom said.
Lily and Ben nodded and ran to the slide. They took turns sliding down and laughing. They had a lot of fun.
But then, Ben saw something shiny in the grass. He ran to it and picked it up. It was a brilliant coin. He was very happy.
""Look, Lily, I found a coin! It's so shiny and pretty!"" Ben said.
""Wow, that's cool! Can I see it?"" Lily said.
Ben showed her the coin. He was very proud.
""Where did you find it?"" Lily asked.
""Over there, in the grass. Maybe there are more. Let's go and look,"" Ben said.
He ran to the grass again, but he did not watch where he was going. He stepped on a hole and tripped. He fell and hurt his knee. He dropped the coin and it rolled away.
""Ow, ow, ow!"" Ben cried.
Lily and mom heard him and ran to him. They helped him up and checked his knee. It was bleeding a little.
""Are you okay, Ben?"" mom asked.
""It hurts, mom. And I lost my coin,"" Ben said.
""I'm sorry, Ben. But you should have listened to me. I told you not to step on the holes. They are dangerous. You have to be careful where you walk,"" mom said.
""I know, mom. I was silly. I only cared about the coin. I should have watched where I was going,"" Ben said.
He hugged mom and said he was sorry. Mom hugged him back and said she forgave him. She put a band-aid on his knee and gave him a kiss.
Lily gave him a hug too and said she was sorry he lost his coin. She said she would share her toys with him.
Ben smiled and thanked her. He said he was lucky to have a mom and a sister who loved him. He said he learned his lesson. He said he would be more careful and not step on holes again.
The end.
